-- 0156_owner_hide_revenue.sql
-- Hide a booking's revenue from the owner until it is revealed (docs/changes/2026-10-25-hide-revenue-from-owner.md). The
-- owner: "I just want to make sure that you implemented the thing where we can hide the revenue from a booking from a car
-- owner and they don't see it right away".
--
-- 1. bookings.owner_visibility: shown (the owner sees the booking and its amounts), until_return (hidden until the car is
--    back), until_statement (hidden until the monthly owner statement covering it is approved), never (a booking with no
--    owner revenue: an internal or placeholder booking for insurance, a shareholder's or the owner's own no-cost use; the
--    owner sees only that the car is unavailable for those dates). A new booking takes the Program setting
--    owner_revenue_visibility (right away by default); staff (an Admin, customer service or fleet) override it on Add a
--    rental, on an offer and on the booking page, with an optional reason, logged in booking_owner_visibility_log.
-- 2. app.booking_owner_view: what the owner may see of a booking: full, booked (the dates and status, no amount) or
--    unavailable (the dates only: no booking number, no amount, no renter). "never" on a booking that carries owner revenue
--    is treated as hidden until the statement: an owner is never shown a lower amount than the statement pays.
-- 3. The owner's reads enforce it in the database: owner_portal_bookings (a new column owner_view), the owner_bookings
--    view, the owner's row policies on booking_splits and owner_deductions, and the month to date of 0151 (a hidden
--    booking is left out of the provisional figures; an unavailable one is listed without its number).
-- 4. The statement is never changed: every booking is on it at its true amounts, so payouts are right. Approving the
--    statement reveals every hidden booking on it (an unavailable one, with no owner revenue, stays as it is).
-- 5. The owner emails with amounts (owner_new_booking, owner_booking_changed) leave the amounts out while hidden
--    (show_amounts); the owner booking notices of an unavailable booking are not sent at all.
-- 6. The staff door: the booking's visibility (read and set), the defaults for the forms, and the visibility given when a
--    rental is added or an offer made.
-- 7. Privileges and the guides.
-- 8. Documented owner deductions on a booking (an expense line, a Revenue Share for the booking within the signed terms):
--    itemized on the statement and in the owner portal, in the booking history, worked into the split.
-- No applied migration is edited.

select app.guide_release_section('admin', 'requests-offers-and-bookings', 'chapter', 'people-and-access', 'A booking starts as a request from the website, or as an offer you send yourself to a customer on the phone. You check it, adjust it and send the offer; an offer that is out is changed in place. After that, the booking page holds the money, documents, changes and history.

## The request queue

Open **Bookings** > **Requests**. The oldest waiting request is at the top.

1. Filter by New, Waiting on the renter, Pushed back, Offer out, Signing and payment, or Offer expired.
2. Waiting shows how long the renter has waited; red means past the first reply target (5 minutes, set in Program settings). Open a booking number to answer it.

2. Adjust the car, the dates, the rate type, the places, the rates and fees, the deposit and extras.

## Send an offer without a request

**Bookings** > **Send an offer**, or **Send an offer** on Bookings and on Requests. For a customer on the phone, by text or at the counter: no request needed.

1. The customer: type a name, phone or email and choose them. Not on file? Press **Add a new customer**: full legal name, mobile, email (the offer link goes there) and date of birth. A customer already on file with the same email or phone is shown with Use: one person, one record.
2. The car and the dates: type the car code, plate or name, or choose from the list; each car says Free or Not free for the dates. Then the pickup and return places (our location, delivery with the address and distance, airport).
3. The price: the Rate sheet, A total for the whole rental, or A rate per day (times the days). A price typed by hand needs its reason and can be plus tax or tax included. Set the kilometres, a promo code, the deposit, a discount and each fee (an Admin), and how damage is covered: with option 3 the Protection Plan price is the one the renter pays.
4. How it is paid: the rental by card online (the usual way), e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout or the insurer; the deposit by card hold, cash, e-Transfer or no deposit (an Admin).
5. Who found this client, the message to the renter, how long the offer is open, and how the link goes: Email, Text, both or neither.
6. The right side is the offer as the renter will see it, priced by the database as you type. Press **Send the offer**. **Save without sending** keeps it as a request for later.

> Good to know: It makes the same request and offer the website makes: the renter approves, signs and pays (or you record the payment), and only then is the car on the calendar. No "request received" email goes to the renter for an offer you send. Staff commissions and statements count it like any other booking.

## Change an offer that is out

The renter has the offer (Offered), or approved it and has not paid (Signing and payment). Press **Edit the offer** on the booking.

1. Change anything: the car, the dates, the places, the price, fees, the deposit, add-ons, how it is paid. Each changed field is highlighted and the before and after are listed.
2. Write what changed in Message to the renter and choose how long the offer is open.
3. Press **Save and send the update**: the renter gets the new version by email or text (ticked), and the old version no longer counts. Or press **Save without telling the renter** and tell them yourself.
4. A confirmed booking is changed with **Change the booking** (Propose a change, below).

> Tip: No need to withdraw first. **Withdraw the offer** is only for taking it back for good; **Send again, later expiry** gives the renter more time, and **Renter approved by phone** records a yes given on a call.

## Edit a booking that has started

On a confirmed, on-trip or returned booking (an Admin: a closed one too), Overview, **Edit the booking**, **Edit**.

1. Change the pickup or the return (extend or shorten: the rental charge is worked out again at this booking''s rates), the car (on trip: the car it leaves goes to Out of service for Fleet to check), the rental charge for the trip, each fee, the kilometres a day, the deposit (an Admin) and the note.
2. Type why, if you like, and tick **Email the renter what changed**, or leave it off for a silent correction. Press **Save the changes**.
3. What is open now shows at once: **Email a pay link** or **Text a pay link** for exactly that amount, **Charge** the saved card (the renter agreed), or record cash or an e-Transfer on the Money tab.

> Good to know: Each edit is kept with who, when, why, before and after (Edits, under the form) and in the booking''s history. A closed booking''s owner split and the staff commission follow. To have the renter accept and sign first, use Propose a change instead.

## Fees, a forgotten fee and the balance

On the booking''s Money tab, Fees lists each fee. Press **Change or add a fee**.

1. Type a new amount (for the whole trip, before HST) beside any fee, or choose one not on the booking (the young driver fee shows its price for these dates), or add a charge of its own with or without HST.
2. Press **Save the fees**. The balance shows by part (rental, fees) with the pay link, the saved card and Record a payment beside it.
3. The renter sees the balance on their booking with a Pay button, and pays by card on Stripe''s form.

> Good to know: Every change is recorded (Changes to the fees): the amount before and after, who and why. Customer service and sales may change fees while Program settings, Staff may change fees, is on.

## Correct a renter''s details

On the renter''s page (People, Renters) or on any of their bookings, **Edit renter**.

1. Correct the name, email, phone, date of birth, licence, home address (start typing to find it) or the staff note.
2. A new email also becomes their sign-in at once (no confirmation needed for a typo you correct); tick **Email the renter a link to set a password** to send one there. Unsigned agreements and offers go to the new address.
3. Press **Save the renter**. An email that another renter has is refused with their name; the same phone is a warning.

## Payments by part: the rental, the deposit and later charges

On the booking''s Money tab, Money by part shows what is still open for the rental, the fees and later charges, the deposit and the card on file. Each part is paid its own way, in any mix: for example the deposit in cash and the rental by card.

1. **Record a payment**: choose what it is for (the rental, fees, the deposit or a later charge) and how it was paid (e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout, the insurer). An e-Transfer, cheque or transfer needs its reference. Press **Record it**. The renter gets a receipt; **Print** prints one to hand over.
2. **Collect a card**: a payment, the deposit hold or saving the card. The renter types the card in Stripe''s secure form: on this device (**Open the card form**, then hand it over) or by a link texted or emailed to them (**Send the link**). Staff never type a card number.
3. A deposit hold lasts about 7 days and shows the days left; while the car is out it is collected by itself before it lapses. After the return, settle the deposit (below). **Capture the hold** for all of it keeps the money; a part capture or **Release the hold** waits for the settlement while the car is out or something is open (an Admin may do it with the reason).
4. **Charge the saved card** (Finance or an Admin): extra kilometres, fuel, damage or a late return, with the reason the renter''s receipt shows. For a rental over 7 days, save the card and charge the deposit this way.
5. An offer paid another way: once the renter approved and signed and the money is recorded, the booking is confirmed (or press **Confirm the booking**).
6. A deposit taken in cash or by e-Transfer is given back the same way after the return: Finance gets a task; press **Returned** with the reference or receipt number.

> Good to know: Statements, reconciliation and the deposit settlement read each payment with its method: a cash deposit is never refunded to a card.

## Settle the deposit

The deposit is never given back by itself. Finance or an Admin settles it after the return: on the booking''s Money tab, under Deposit, press **Settle the deposit**. Issue the Check-in statement first.

1. The form shows the deposit, what is still available, the charges owed from the statement and what is taken from the deposit for them. What the deposit does not cover is charged to the card on file; with no card (or a card declined), the renter gets a pay link by email and text, and Finance has a task until it is paid.
2. Tolls and tickets can take up to 7 days to come in. Inside that window the whole rest of the deposit is filled in as the hold-back, until the window ends. To give it back sooner, tick Release now anyway: a toll that comes in later is charged to the card on file.
3. Something still open keeps the whole deposit: an incident, a claim, new damage at the return not priced, damage found later not billed, a toll or ticket on the car during the rental not matched or not charged, a card dispute, or charges not on a statement yet. The form lists them. Only an Admin can release part of it, with the reason; it is recorded.
4. Damage: **Keep the whole deposit (damage)** turns what is left of the deposit into a damage charge, with what was damaged and the photos; the renter is told. **Bill damage** adds a damage charge up to the $2,500 deductible (more goes through a claim): the deposit pays first, then the card on file.
5. Press **Settle**. The money moves at Stripe at once: the charges are collected and what is not owed is refunded or the hold released. A step Stripe refuses is tried again by itself, and Finance gets a task if it keeps failing.

> Good to know: A card hold lapses after about 7 days. While the car is out, or returned and not settled, the hold is collected in full a day and a half before it lapses: that keeps the money, and the settlement refunds what is not owed. A hold that lapses anyway is charged to the saved card, and Finance is told at once.

## A booking

Open **Bookings** > **Bookings**, then a booking number. Or type the number in the search box.

1. Tabs: Overview, Money, Changes, History, and Drivers and documents.
2. Overview shows the trip, the renter, what is still missing for the handover, and the price.
3. Open tasks for this booking, with the queue and the due time.
4. Top right: **Stop blocking the calendar**, **Cancel for the renter** and **Cancel by CarmaCars**.

![](/guides/img/admin-04-booking-desktop-b56b668a.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 960; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10057; pins: 1 20.1 24.0, 2 34.7 58.3, 3 20.1 72.9, 4 90.3 18.3")

## Check a car out or in

From the booking, with your phone or a tablet: the same checklist field staff use.

1. A confirmed booking shows **Check out (pickup)** under Check-out, check-in and signing; a booking on rent shows **Check in (return)**. Today lists the check-outs and check-ins due, each with **Check out** or **Check in**.
2. The checklist opens: the ready check, the renter and their licence and card, the odometer (km) and fuel or charge, the keys, the photo set (every side, the wheels, the interior, the odometer and fuel gauge, the plate), damage marks with close-ups, then the renter and you sign.
3. Photos wait on the device without a connection and upload in the background. Each keeps its time, and the place when the device allows location.
4. A field job of the booking is taken over (the history says so); with no job, one is made for you. When done, press **See the photo report**.

> Tip: Fleet, Sales and Customer service check cars out and in the same way from their own booking page.

## The photo report, late returns and the return charges

Under Check-out, check-in and signing, press **Photo report**.

1. The report shows the due-back time, the actual check-out and check-in, Late by (or Overdue by while the car is out), the odometer and kilometres over the allowance, the fuel or charge out and in, every photo with its time and place, and the damage.
2. At check-in the late return (after the grace period of the fee defaults), the mileage overage and the fuel or recharging are written to the return charges at once. A gas car with no pump receipt is priced at the refill price per eighth (Program settings) plus the markup until the receipt is entered.
3. Not charging one? Press **Waive** beside it and give the reason: it stays waived if the charges are worked out again.
4. The time was wrong? Press **Correct the check-in time** (or the check-out time) with the reason: lateness and the late charges follow, and the history keeps both times.
5. The renter gets the same report (without these buttons) by email and in their Documents. Late by shows on the booking and in the Bookings list.

## Signatures on the spot, or by link

The renter or an additional driver signs the rental agreement on your device, or on their own phone.

1. While a signature is missing, the booking shows **Sign now on this device**, **Email the signing link** and **Text the signing link**.
2. **Sign now on this device**: confirm the name matches their licence and that you saw the original licence (photograph it if none is on file), then press **Hand the device to** and their name.
3. They read both agreements (CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s), tick the statements and sign. Then **Back to the staff view** for the next signer.
4. The record is the same as signing online, and says it was signed in person, collected by you, on your device. It is printed on the signed copy''s signature record page.

## Rental agreements: every version, every field

The booking''s Rental agreements card: the current version of CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s agreements, every earlier one, and what is still blank.

1. Once the agreement is signed and countersigned, any change to what it prints makes a new version of both documents by itself: the dates, the price lines, the car, a driver added or corrected, the coverage, the deposit or how it was paid, an address.
2. A change to the dates, the price, the car, the drivers or the coverage option is signed again: the renter (and each driver it affects) gets their link by email and text, and the card shows "Agreement v3 waiting for signature". A correction (a typo in an address, a plate written differently) is filed without signing; the renter gets the corrected copy by email.
3. Check-out makes the "as picked up" copy (time out, km out, fuel out, the car''s plate and VIN, the check-out report), countersigned by whoever checked the car out; check-in makes the closing copy (time in, km in, driven and charged, fuel in, late hours, damage, the return charges, the final totals). Both go to the renter by email.
4. **Every version** lists each one with what changed and both PDFs. **Resend the signing links**, or press the button with their first name beside it to have them sign on your phone or tablet.
5. The card lists what the agreements still print blank (a licence expiry, the insurer''s policy number, the insured vehicle, a VIN). Type the values and press **Save the missing fields**: the agreements follow.
6. Check-out stops while a field a claim needs is blank. An Admin can let it go ahead: type the reason and press **Override**; the reason is in the booking''s history.
7. **Make the agreements again** checks both against the booking at once (they also follow every change by themselves).

## Signing that holds up in a dispute

Every signature of a rental agreement, an amendment or a new version is made the same way, remotely or on your device.

1. The signer confirms it is them with a 6-digit code sent to their phone or email on file; the licence on file is shown.
2. They say they read the documents, initial the key terms (damage and the deductible, the deposit and later charges, fuel, kilometres and late returns, their coverage, cancellation), give three consents (to sign electronically, to receive records electronically, to card charges under the agreement) and draw their signature.
3. Each step is recorded with its time, IP address and device, and the place when the device shares it. The signed PDFs end with a certificate of completion; anyone can check a signed file at `carmacars.ca/verify`.
4. Typed names are off. For a signer who cannot draw, an Admin can turn on the accessibility fallback: **Settings** > **Program**, Esign typed fallback.

## Card disputes: the evidence pack

Everything that proves the rental, in one PDF for Stripe.

1. When a card payment is disputed, the evidence pack is built by itself: the signed agreements with their certificates, the check-out and check-in reports with photos, kilometres and fuel, the licence, the payments and charges, every message to the renter, and the card checks from Stripe. It is staged in Stripe as the dispute''s evidence, and To do gets an urgent task.
2. Open the booking: the Rental agreements card shows the pack. Press **Download** to check it, then **Submit to Stripe** before the evidence date.
3. **Build the dispute evidence pack** makes one at any time (an Admin or Finance).

## The licence before an offer is accepted

Front, back and a selfie, from the request on.

1. After sending a request the renter is asked for their licence. A licence already on file from an earlier booking is used again while it is valid after the return.
2. The offer cannot be accepted (by the renter, or by you on their word) and nothing is paid until the licence and its expiry date are on file.
3. Review the images as usual with **Review documents**: the card Renter documents is on Review and offer too.
4. The switch is in **Settings** > **Program**, Booking requests and offers: Booking licence required (on), with the selfie (on).

## Renter documents: licence and proof of coverage

A renter''s licence photos, selfie and proof of coverage (OPCF 27 or a credit card''s rental coverage) are checked before the handover. You check them yourself; no task is needed.

1. A booking with documents waiting is a line on To do: "Check ''s documents for booking ", marked Now when the pickup is within two days. Press **Review documents**.
2. The pop-up shows each driver''s images and the coverage: the insurer, policy number and expiry, or the card, its type and whether the name matches.
3. What to check is written once at the top. One wrong? Open **Reject this one** under it, type the reason the renter reads and press **Reject**: they are asked for a new one.
4. Then press **Approve all**: every image, the proof of coverage and the Protection Plan still waiting are approved in one step. Anything the system refuses is named with the reason.
5. The same pop-up is on the booking: the card Renter documents (**Review documents**) on Overview and on Drivers and documents.

> Tip: Each opening of a renter''s documents is logged. The links to the images last one minute. Field staff can also check a licence in person at the check-out (photos and four checks): the history says "checked in person".

## Payments by day

**Money** > **Payments by day**: every payment and refund of a day or a range, by method, the cash drawer and the refunds waiting. Finance has the same screen.

1. Choose From and To and the methods (card, e-Transfer, cash, cheque, platform payout, insurer, bank transfer, pre-authorized debit, other), then press **Show**.
2. Totals by method and for each day; cards read as the card and its last four digits, never a code.
3. The cash drawer: expected (cash in less cash given back) against the count Finance records with **Record the count**; a difference shows over or short.
4. Refunds waiting: every refund asked for anywhere with the policy maths. **Approve** or **Decline** with the reason in the row, then **Issue the refund**.
5. **Export CSV** for the bookkeeper.

## Propose a change to a confirmed booking

The renter gets an email and answers on their booking. The calendar moves only when they accept.

1. Open the booking''s Changes tab. Under Propose a change, set the new pickup, return or car.
2. To price it by hand, type a New rental charge before tax. Leave it empty to use the car''s rates.
3. Write the Reason, for the renter. They read it.
4. Press **Preview the price**, then **Send to the renter**.

![](/guides/img/admin-05-booking-changes-desktop-0b06af9a.jpg "desktop; size: 1230 530; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10057?tab=changes; pins: 1 12.9 15.3, 2 35.0 30.6, 3 49.8 59.1, 4 30.9 73.2")

## Who a booking is credited to

Overview (and Review and offer) shows the Sales credit: the staff member the booking counts for in their sales.

1. A quote or a rental is credited to whoever created or added it. A request from the website is credited to whoever sent its first offer.
2. To give it to someone else, press **Reassign**, choose who (or Nobody), say whether they sourced the client and write the reason. The booking''s history and the audit log keep it, and the deal stays in the same week and month.
3. Sourced means the staff member chose I sourced this client when they entered it, it came with a field staff referral link, or you credited it. Only a sourced booking earns a staff commission. A website request earns none unless you credit someone.
4. Someone said they sourced a website request? The credit line shows the claim: press **Credit them** or **Not theirs**, with a reason.
5. A price typed by hand shows beside the rate-sheet price, with the reason. A price under the floor or past the discount limit is flagged: press **Mark reviewed** once you have looked at it.

> Tip: The renter has 48 hours to accept (and sign the amendment) or decline, with one reminder. Any extra is charged to their Card on File; a lower price raises a refund for your approval.

## Review requests

Every renter is asked for a review by email and text, as they chose, only from 9 am to 9 pm Toronto time. Nothing needs setting up.

| Message | When |
| --- | --- |
| Mid-trip check-in | Rentals of 2 days or more, 24 hours after the pickup: "How is the car? Reply or call if anything is off." No review ask. |
| Review request | 1 hour after the check-in. It links the review page: the renter taps what they liked, adds a sentence, and gets a short draft to copy and post on Google. |
| Reminder | 24 hours after the request. |
| Final follow-up | 7 days after the request. Nothing more after it. |

1. The booking page has the card Review requests: each message with when it went or when it will go, and why it stopped.
2. **Ask for a review** sends the request now (or at 9 am if it is later than 9 pm), on any booking on a trip, returned or closed. Not twice in 24 hours.
3. On hold: a return or later charge (late return, kilometres, fuel, cleaning, smoking, damage, tolls and tickets) is not settled or waived, or an incident or dispute is open. The request goes by itself once they are. Press **Send anyway** to send it now.
4. **Mark reviewed** stops the messages when the renter tells you they already reviewed.

The messages also stop by themselves when the renter presses "I already left a review", leaves a review on the site, unsubscribes, or a Google review is matched to them. **Bookings** > **Reviews** has the numbers (requests sent, on hold, reviews detected, the average rating), the hold list and the Google reviews to match.

> Tip: The draft is made only from what the renter picked and wrote, and from the booking (the car, how long, delivery or pickup). Everyone gets the Google link, whatever their stars; a renter who gives 3 stars or fewer also sees "Something wasn''t right? Tell us directly".

## What the owner sees, and owner deductions

Each booking on an owner''s or partner''s car shows the card What the owner sees at the top of its page.

1. **Hide from the owner** keeps the booking''s revenue from the owner until the car is returned, or until the owner statement covering it is approved. The owner sees the booking as Booked with its dates, and the calendar still shows the car busy. Add a reason if you like: it is kept in the history.
2. **Show to the owner** shows it now. Approving the statement shows every hidden booking on it by itself.
3. Not shown to the owner is for a booking with no owner revenue (an insurance placeholder, a shareholder''s or the owner''s own use at no charge): the owner sees only that the car is unavailable for those dates. A booking with revenue cannot be set this way.
4. Add a rental and Send an offer have What the owner sees. It starts from Settings > Program, Owners and fleet: Owners see a booking''s revenue (right away by default).
5. On the Money tab, Owner deductions on this booking: **Add a booking expense** (cleaning, repair, fuel, platform fee or other, the amount, the reason the owner reads, a receipt number) comes off before Owner Revenue.
6. **Set the Revenue Share for this booking** applies within the car''s signed terms. Above the terms only an Admin can, with Above the signed terms ticked and the reason. **Back to the car''s terms** undoes it.
7. Add a rental has the same under The car''s owner.

> Good to know: The owner''s statement always includes every booking at its true amounts and lists each deduction with its reason, so the payout is always right. Customer service and sales add deductions only while Program settings let them change fees.
', 'Requests, offers and bookings', 'Send an offer with or without a request, change it in place, take payments by part, run a booking, propose a change.',
  'A booking starts as a request from the website, or as an offer you send yourself to a customer on the phone. You check it, adjust it and send the offer; an offer that is out is changed in place. After that, the booking page holds the money, documents, changes and history.

## The request queue

Open **Bookings** > **Requests**. The oldest waiting request is at the top.

1. Filter by New, Waiting on the renter, Pushed back, Offer out, Signing and payment, or Offer expired.
2. Waiting shows how long the renter has waited; red means past the first reply target (5 minutes, set in Program settings). Open a booking number to answer it.

![](/guides/img/admin-02-requests-desktop-6521282d.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 820; address: carmacars.ca/admin/requests; pins: 1 18.5 21.2, 2 25.3 31.7")

> Good to know: A request whose pickup time passes without an offer expires by itself, with a note in its history. The renter is not emailed unless "Email the renter when their request expires that way" is on in Program settings.

## Answer a request with an offer

1. The Review and offer tab shows the request as the renter sent it.
2. Adjust the car, the dates, the rate type, the places, the rates and fees, the deposit and extras.
3. Price on the right updates as you change things.
4. Add a message, choose how long the offer stays open, then press **Send the offer**.

![](/guides/img/admin-03-booking-review-desktop-84570463.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 1060; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10056?tab=review; pins: 1 21.7 16.4, 2 20.0 45.4, 3 65.0 45.4, 4 96.5 98.8")

5. Changed fields but not ready to send? Press **Save changes**. The panel "The offer as the renter sees it" shows the result.
6. Can''t do it? Press **Decline** and fill in Reason and any alternative.
7. Need an answer first? Press **Ask the renter** to send a question.

![](/guides/img/admin-03-booking-review-desktop-1139f8f9.jpg "desktop; size: 620 810; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10056?tab=review; pins: 5 91.9 33.6")

## Send an offer without a request

**Bookings** > **Send an offer**, or **Send an offer** on Bookings and on Requests. For a customer on the phone, by text or at the counter: no request needed.

1. The customer: type a name, phone or email and choose them. Not on file? Press **Add a new customer**: full legal name, mobile, email (the offer link goes there) and date of birth. A customer already on file with the same email or phone is shown with Use: one person, one record.
2. The car and the dates: type the car code, plate or name, or choose from the list; each car says Free or Not free for the dates. Then the pickup and return places (our location, delivery with the address and distance, airport).
3. The price: the Rate sheet, A total for the whole rental, or A rate per day (times the days). A price typed by hand needs its reason and can be plus tax or tax included. Set the kilometres, a promo code, the deposit, a discount and each fee (an Admin), and how damage is covered: with option 3 the Protection Plan price is the one the renter pays.
4. How it is paid: the rental by card online (the usual way), e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout or the insurer; the deposit by card hold, cash, e-Transfer or no deposit (an Admin).
5. Who found this client, the message to the renter, how long the offer is open, and how the link goes: Email, Text, both or neither.
6. The right side is the offer as the renter will see it, priced by the database as you type. Press **Send the offer**. **Save without sending** keeps it as a request for later.

> Good to know: It makes the same request and offer the website makes: the renter approves, signs and pays (or you record the payment), and only then is the car on the calendar. No "request received" email goes to the renter for an offer you send. Staff commissions and statements count it like any other booking.

## Change an offer that is out

The renter has the offer (Offered), or approved it and has not paid (Signing and payment). Press **Edit the offer** on the booking.

1. Change anything: the car, the dates, the places, the price, fees, the deposit, add-ons, how it is paid. Each changed field is highlighted and the before and after are listed.
2. Write what changed in Message to the renter and choose how long the offer is open.
3. Press **Save and send the update**: the renter gets the new version by email or text (ticked), and the old version no longer counts. Or press **Save without telling the renter** and tell them yourself.
4. A confirmed booking is changed with **Change the booking** (Propose a change, below).

> Tip: No need to withdraw first. **Withdraw the offer** is only for taking it back for good; **Send again, later expiry** gives the renter more time, and **Renter approved by phone** records a yes given on a call.

## Edit a booking that has started

On a confirmed, on-trip or returned booking (an Admin: a closed one too), Overview, **Edit the booking**, **Edit**.

1. Change the pickup or the return (extend or shorten: the rental charge is worked out again at this booking''s rates), the car (on trip: the car it leaves goes to Out of service for Fleet to check), the rental charge for the trip, each fee, the kilometres a day, the deposit (an Admin) and the note.
2. Type why, if you like, and tick **Email the renter what changed**, or leave it off for a silent correction. Press **Save the changes**.
3. What is open now shows at once: **Email a pay link** or **Text a pay link** for exactly that amount, **Charge** the saved card (the renter agreed), or record cash or an e-Transfer on the Money tab.

> Good to know: Each edit is kept with who, when, why, before and after (Edits, under the form) and in the booking''s history. A closed booking''s owner split and the staff commission follow. To have the renter accept and sign first, use Propose a change instead.

## Fees, a forgotten fee and the balance

On the booking''s Money tab, Fees lists each fee. Press **Change or add a fee**.

1. Type a new amount (for the whole trip, before HST) beside any fee, or choose one not on the booking (the young driver fee shows its price for these dates), or add a charge of its own with or without HST.
2. Press **Save the fees**. The balance shows by part (rental, fees) with the pay link, the saved card and Record a payment beside it.
3. The renter sees the balance on their booking with a Pay button, and pays by card on Stripe''s form.

> Good to know: Every change is recorded (Changes to the fees): the amount before and after, who and why. Customer service and sales may change fees while Program settings, Staff may change fees, is on.

## Correct a renter''s details

On the renter''s page (People, Renters) or on any of their bookings, **Edit renter**.

1. Correct the name, email, phone, date of birth, licence, home address (start typing to find it) or the staff note.
2. A new email also becomes their sign-in at once (no confirmation needed for a typo you correct); tick **Email the renter a link to set a password** to send one there. Unsigned agreements and offers go to the new address.
3. Press **Save the renter**. An email that another renter has is refused with their name; the same phone is a warning.
4. The same person entered twice? Possible duplicates (same email, same phone, or same name and date of birth) shows under the renter. **Merge into this record** moves the other record''s bookings, licences, cards, payments, documents and messages here and fills any detail missing here; the other record stays, blocked, with the merge in both histories.

## Payments by part: the rental, the deposit and later charges

On the booking''s Money tab, Money by part shows what is still open for the rental, the fees and later charges, the deposit and the card on file. Each part is paid its own way, in any mix: for example the deposit in cash and the rental by card.

1. **Record a payment**: choose what it is for (the rental, fees, the deposit or a later charge) and how it was paid (e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout, the insurer). An e-Transfer, cheque or transfer needs its reference. Press **Record it**. The renter gets a receipt; **Print** prints one to hand over.
2. **Collect a card**: a payment (Everything open by default: the rental, the fees and any later charge in one), the deposit hold or saving the card. The renter types the card in Stripe''s secure form: on this device (**Open the card form**, then hand it over) or by a link texted or emailed to them (**Send the link**). Staff never type a card number.
3. A deposit hold lasts about 7 days and shows the days left; while the car is out it is collected by itself before it lapses. After the return, settle the deposit (below). **Capture the hold** for all of it keeps the money; a part capture or **Release the hold** waits for the settlement while the car is out or something is open (an Admin may do it with the reason).
4. **Charge the saved card** (Finance or an Admin): extra kilometres, fuel, damage or a late return, with the reason the renter''s receipt shows. For a rental over 7 days, save the card and charge the deposit this way.
5. An offer paid another way: once the renter approved and signed and the money is recorded, the booking is confirmed (or press **Confirm the booking**).
6. A deposit taken in cash or by e-Transfer is given back the same way after the return: Finance gets a task; press **Returned** with the reference or receipt number.

> Good to know: Statements, reconciliation and the deposit settlement read each payment with its method: a cash deposit is never refunded to a card.

## Settle the deposit

The deposit is never given back by itself. Finance or an Admin settles it after the return: on the booking''s Money tab, under Deposit, press **Settle the deposit**. Issue the Check-in statement first.

1. The form shows the deposit, what is still available, the charges owed from the statement and what is taken from the deposit for them. What the deposit does not cover is charged to the card on file; with no card (or a card declined), the renter gets a pay link by email and text, and Finance has a task until it is paid.
2. Tolls and tickets can take up to 7 days to come in. Inside that window the whole rest of the deposit is filled in as the hold-back, until the window ends. To give it back sooner, tick Release now anyway: a toll that comes in later is charged to the card on file.
3. Something still open keeps the whole deposit: an incident, a claim, new damage at the return not priced, damage found later not billed, a toll or ticket on the car during the rental not matched or not charged, a card dispute, or charges not on a statement yet. The form lists them. Only an Admin can release part of it, with the reason; it is recorded.
4. Damage: **Keep the whole deposit (damage)** turns what is left of the deposit into a damage charge, with what was damaged and the photos; the renter is told. **Bill damage** adds a damage charge up to the $2,500 deductible (more goes through a claim): the deposit pays first, then the card on file.
5. Press **Settle**. The money moves at Stripe at once: the charges are collected and what is not owed is refunded or the hold released. A step Stripe refuses is tried again by itself, and Finance gets a task if it keeps failing.

> Good to know: A card hold lapses after about 7 days. While the car is out, or returned and not settled, the hold is collected in full a day and a half before it lapses: that keeps the money, and the settlement refunds what is not owed. A hold that lapses anyway is charged to the saved card, and Finance is told at once.

## A booking

Open **Bookings** > **Bookings**, then a booking number. Or type the number in the search box.

1. Tabs: Overview, Money, Changes, History, and Drivers and documents.
2. Overview shows the trip, the renter, what is still missing for the handover, and the price.
3. Open tasks for this booking, with the queue and the due time.
4. Top right: **Stop blocking the calendar**, **Cancel for the renter** and **Cancel by CarmaCars**.

![](/guides/img/admin-04-booking-desktop-b56b668a.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 960; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10057; pins: 1 20.1 24.0, 2 34.7 58.3, 3 20.1 72.9, 4 90.3 18.3")

## Check a car out or in

From the booking, with your phone or a tablet: the same checklist field staff use.

1. A confirmed booking shows **Check out (pickup)** under Check-out, check-in and signing; a booking on rent shows **Check in (return)**. Today lists the check-outs and check-ins due, each with **Check out** or **Check in**.
2. The checklist opens: the ready check, the renter and their licence and card, the odometer (km) and fuel or charge, the keys, the photo set (every side, the wheels, the interior, the odometer and fuel gauge, the plate), damage marks with close-ups, then the renter and you sign.
3. Photos wait on the device without a connection and upload in the background. Each keeps its time, and the place when the device allows location.
4. A field job of the booking is taken over (the history says so); with no job, one is made for you. When done, press **See the photo report**.

> Tip: Fleet, Sales and Customer service check cars out and in the same way from their own booking page.

## The photo report, late returns and the return charges

Under Check-out, check-in and signing, press **Photo report**.

1. The report shows the due-back time, the actual check-out and check-in, Late by (or Overdue by while the car is out), the odometer and kilometres over the allowance, the fuel or charge out and in, every photo with its time and place, and the damage.
2. At check-in the late return (after the grace period of the fee defaults), the mileage overage and the fuel or recharging are written to the return charges at once. A gas car with no pump receipt is priced at the refill price per eighth (Program settings) plus the markup until the receipt is entered.
3. Not charging one? Press **Waive** beside it and give the reason: it stays waived if the charges are worked out again.
4. The time was wrong? Press **Correct the check-in time** (or the check-out time) with the reason: lateness and the late charges follow, and the history keeps both times.
5. The renter gets the same report (without these buttons) by email and in their Documents. Late by shows on the booking and in the Bookings list.

## Signatures on the spot, or by link

The renter or an additional driver signs the rental agreement on your device, or on their own phone.

1. While a signature is missing, the booking shows **Sign now on this device**, **Email the signing link** and **Text the signing link**.
2. No agreement made yet (the renter has not saved their details at home)? **Sign now on this device** still shows: press **Prepare the agreement to sign now** and it is made on the spot.
3. **Sign now on this device**: confirm the name matches their licence and that you saw the original licence (photograph it if none is on file), then press **Hand the device to** and their name.
4. They read both agreements (CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s), tick the statements and sign. Then **Back to the staff view** for the next signer.
5. The record is the same as signing online, and says it was signed in person, collected by you, on your device. It is printed on the signed copy''s signature record page.

## Rental agreements: every version, every field

The booking''s Rental agreements card: the current version of CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s agreements, every earlier one, and what is still blank.

1. Once the agreement is signed and countersigned, any change to what it prints makes a new version of both documents by itself: the dates, the price lines, the car, a driver added or corrected, the coverage, the deposit or how it was paid, an address.
2. A change to the dates, the price, the car, the drivers or the coverage option is signed again: the renter (and each driver it affects) gets their link by email and text, and the card shows "Agreement v3 waiting for signature". A correction (a typo in an address, a plate written differently) is filed without signing; the renter gets the corrected copy by email.
3. Check-out makes the "as picked up" copy (time out, km out, fuel out, the car''s plate and VIN, the check-out report), countersigned by whoever checked the car out; check-in makes the closing copy (time in, km in, driven and charged, fuel in, late hours, damage, the return charges, the final totals). Both go to the renter by email.
4. **Every version** lists each one with what changed and both PDFs. **Resend the signing links**, or press the button with their first name beside it to have them sign on your phone or tablet.
5. The card lists what the agreements still print blank (a licence expiry, the insurer''s policy number, the insured vehicle, a VIN). Type the values and press **Save the missing fields**: the agreements follow.
6. Check-out stops while a field a claim needs is blank. An Admin can let it go ahead: type the reason and press **Override**; the reason is in the booking''s history.
7. **Make the agreements again** checks both against the booking at once (they also follow every change by themselves).

## Signing that holds up in a dispute

Every signature of a rental agreement, an amendment or a new version is made the same way, remotely or on your device.

1. The signer confirms it is them with a 6-digit code sent to their phone or email on file; the licence on file is shown.
2. They say they read the documents, initial the key terms (damage and the deductible, the deposit and later charges, fuel, kilometres and late returns, their coverage, cancellation), give three consents (to sign electronically, to receive records electronically, to card charges under the agreement) and draw their signature.
3. Each step is recorded with its time, IP address and device, and the place when the device shares it. The signed PDFs end with a certificate of completion; anyone can check a signed file at `carmacars.ca/verify`.
4. Typed names are off. For a signer who cannot draw, an Admin can turn on the accessibility fallback: **Settings** > **Program**, Esign typed fallback.

## Card disputes: the evidence pack

Everything that proves the rental, in one PDF for Stripe.

1. When a card payment is disputed, the evidence pack is built by itself: the signed agreements with their certificates, the check-out and check-in reports with photos, kilometres and fuel, the licence, the payments and charges, every message to the renter, and the card checks from Stripe. It is staged in Stripe as the dispute''s evidence, and To do gets an urgent task.
2. Open the booking: the Rental agreements card shows the pack. Press **Download** to check it, then **Submit to Stripe** before the evidence date.
3. **Build the dispute evidence pack** makes one at any time (an Admin or Finance).

## The licence before an offer is accepted

Front, back and a selfie, from the request on.

1. After sending a request the renter is asked for their licence. A licence already on file from an earlier booking is used again while it is valid after the return.
2. The offer cannot be accepted (by the renter, or by you on their word) and nothing is paid until the licence and its expiry date are on file.
3. Review the images as usual with **Review documents**: the card Renter documents is on Review and offer too.
4. The switch is in **Settings** > **Program**, Booking requests and offers: Booking licence required (on), with the selfie (on).

## Renter documents: licence and proof of coverage

A renter''s licence photos, selfie and proof of coverage (OPCF 27 or a credit card''s rental coverage) are checked before the handover. You check them yourself; no task is needed.

1. A booking with documents waiting is a line on To do: "Check ''s documents for booking ", marked Now when the pickup is within two days. Press **Review documents**.
2. The pop-up shows each driver''s images and the coverage: the insurer, policy number and expiry, or the card, its type and whether the name matches.
3. What to check is written once at the top. One wrong? Open **Reject this one** under it, type the reason the renter reads and press **Reject**: they are asked for a new one.
4. Then press **Approve all**: every image, the proof of coverage and the Protection Plan still waiting are approved in one step. Anything the system refuses is named with the reason.
5. The same pop-up is on the booking: the card Renter documents (**Review documents**) on Overview and on Drivers and documents.

> Tip: Each opening of a renter''s documents is logged. The links to the images last one minute. Field staff can also check a licence in person at the check-out (photos and four checks): the history says "checked in person".

## Payments by day

**Money** > **Payments by day**: every payment and refund of a day or a range, by method, the cash drawer and the refunds waiting. Finance has the same screen.

1. Choose From and To and the methods (card, e-Transfer, cash, cheque, platform payout, insurer, bank transfer, pre-authorized debit, other), then press **Show**.
2. Totals by method and for each day; cards read as the card and its last four digits, never a code.
3. The cash drawer: expected (cash in less cash given back) against the count Finance records with **Record the count**; a difference shows over or short.
4. Refunds waiting: every refund asked for anywhere with the policy maths. **Approve** or **Decline** with the reason in the row, then **Issue the refund**.
5. **Export CSV** for the bookkeeper.

## Propose a change to a confirmed booking

The renter gets an email and answers on their booking. The calendar moves only when they accept.

1. Open the booking''s Changes tab. Under Propose a change, set the new pickup, return or car.
2. To price it by hand, type a New rental charge before tax. Leave it empty to use the car''s rates.
3. Write the Reason, for the renter. They read it.
4. Press **Preview the price**, then **Send to the renter**.

## Who a booking is credited to

Overview (and Review and offer) shows the Sales credit: the staff member the booking counts for in their sales.

1. A quote or a rental is credited to whoever created or added it. A request from the website is credited to whoever sent its first offer.
2. To give it to someone else, press **Reassign**, choose who (or Nobody), say whether they sourced the client and write the reason. The booking''s history and the audit log keep it, and the deal stays in the same week and month.
3. Sourced means the staff member chose I sourced this client when they entered it, it came with a field staff referral link, or you credited it. Only a sourced booking earns a staff commission. A website request earns none unless you credit someone.
4. Someone said they sourced a website request? The credit line shows the claim: press **Credit them** or **Not theirs**, with a reason.
5. A price typed by hand shows beside the rate-sheet price, with the reason. A price under the floor or past the discount limit is flagged: press **Mark reviewed** once you have looked at it.

> Tip: The renter has 48 hours to accept (and sign the amendment) or decline, with one reminder. Any extra is charged to their Card on File; a lower price raises a refund for your approval.

## Review requests

Every renter is asked for a review by email and text, as they chose, only from 9 am to 9 pm Toronto time. Nothing needs setting up.

| Message | When |
| --- | --- |
| Mid-trip check-in | Rentals of 2 days or more, 24 hours after the pickup: "How is the car? Reply or call if anything is off." No review ask. |
| Review request | 1 hour after the check-in. It links the review page: the renter taps what they liked, adds a sentence, and gets a short draft to copy and post on Google. |
| Reminder | 24 hours after the request. |
| Final follow-up | 7 days after the request. Nothing more after it. |

1. The booking page has the card Review requests: each message with when it went or when it will go, and why it stopped.
2. **Ask for a review** sends the request now (or at 9 am if it is later than 9 pm), on any booking on a trip, returned or closed. Not twice in 24 hours.
3. On hold: a return or later charge (late return, kilometres, fuel, cleaning, smoking, damage, tolls and tickets) is not settled or waived, or an incident or dispute is open. The request goes by itself once they are. Press **Send anyway** to send it now.
4. **Mark reviewed** stops the messages when the renter tells you they already reviewed.

The messages also stop by themselves when the renter presses "I already left a review", leaves a review on the site, unsubscribes, or a Google review is matched to them. **Bookings** > **Reviews** has the numbers (requests sent, on hold, reviews detected, the average rating), the hold list and the Google reviews to match.

> Tip: The draft is made only from what the renter picked and wrote, and from the booking (the car, how long, delivery or pickup). Everyone gets the Google link, whatever their stars; a renter who gives 3 stars or fewer also sees "Something wasn''t right? Tell us directly".

## What the owner sees, and owner deductions

Each booking on an owner''s or partner''s car shows the card What the owner sees at the top of its page.

1. **Hide from the owner** keeps the booking''s revenue from the owner until the car is returned, or until the owner statement covering it is approved. The owner sees the booking as Booked with its dates, and the calendar still shows the car busy. Add a reason if you like: it is kept in the history.
2. **Show to the owner** shows it now. Approving the statement shows every hidden booking on it by itself.
3. Not shown to the owner is for a booking with no owner revenue (an insurance placeholder, a shareholder''s or the owner''s own use at no charge): the owner sees only that the car is unavailable for those dates. A booking with revenue cannot be set this way.
4. Add a rental and Send an offer have What the owner sees. It starts from Settings > Program, Owners and fleet: Owners see a booking''s revenue (right away by default).
5. On the Money tab, Owner deductions on this booking: **Add a booking expense** (cleaning, repair, fuel, platform fee or other, the amount, the reason the owner reads, a receipt number) comes off before Owner Revenue.
6. **Set the Revenue Share for this booking** applies within the car''s signed terms. Above the terms only an Admin can, with Above the signed terms ticked and the reason. **Back to the car''s terms** undoes it.
7. Add a rental has the same under The car''s owner.

> Good to know: The owner''s statement always includes every booking at its true amounts and lists each deduction with its reason, so the payout is always right. Customer service and sales add deductions only while Program settings let them change fees.

## Add a car

**Cars** > **Vehicles**, then **Add a car**. Start with the VIN: everything else about the car comes from it.

1. Type or paste the VIN. At the 17th character the car is looked up: one line shows the year, make, model, trim, body, seats, doors, fuel, drive, gearbox and engine. Press Edit only if something is wrong.
2. When the VIN fits several trims, the form asks which trim it is: press the one on the car''s papers or badge, or **Not sure** (Admin > Today asks again).
3. No VIN at hand? Press **No VIN at hand? Add the car by its plate** and choose the year, make and model from the lists. The VIN can be added later; the details fill in then.
4. Tap the colour (it is not in the VIN). Leave it empty and it is read from the cover photo once the car has one.
5. Check the class. It is set from the make, model, body and age (a 2016 Porsche Macan is Premium, an SUV is SUV) and the line under it says why. Change it if it is wrong.
6. Choose who supplies it: **A program owner''s car** (choose the owner; the car starts its onboarding), **CarmaCars-owned (company fleet)** (no owner; all of its revenue is CarmaCars'') or **A partner rental company''s car** (choose the partner; leave the commission empty to use the partner''s).
7. The daily rate is filled in from similar cars, else the class. Keep it, change it, or empty it and set the rates later on the car''s Rates tab. Press **Add the car**.

> Tip: The title, description and features are written by themselves right after the car is added, from the VIN details. Change any of them on the car''s listing; a field you change is kept.

> Good to know: Every car gets a fleet number and its standard settings the moment it is added: a complete rate card (the daily rate you typed or the suggested one, weekend, weekly and monthly from it, the kilometres a day, the extra kilometre rate, the deposit and the delivery and pickup fee of its class) and drivers 18 to 20 allowed. Each value set this way says (Set automatically) on the car''s Overview and Rates tab until you change it. The defaults come from Settings: Program and Fee defaults.

> Tip: A VIN that does not add up (one character misread) shows a warning; you can still save it. A VIN the decoder cannot read asks only the year, make and model and never stops you: the details fill in when it is read later. The duplicate check runs as for every car: a VIN only once, a plate on one active car, and a likely twin waits for you in Similar cars before it is published.

The gearbox comes from the government''s fuel economy data for the model when it has one gearbox for it, or from the VIN when the VIN states it. Seats come from the VIN, or the usual number for the body (4 for a coupe or convertible, 5 for a sedan, SUV or hatchback). When either is not certain, Admin > Today shows **Confirm gearbox and seats**: press the gearbox and the number of seats, then **Save**. A car whose VIN fits several trims shows **Pick the trim** there: press the right one. Either way the title, description and search text are written again.

On a car''s page, **Who supplies the car** shows the supplier and the commission, and changes them. Vehicles filters by supply type.

## Partners

**People** > **Partners**. Partner rental companies whose cars we rent out on commission.

1. Press **Add a partner**: business and legal name, contacts, HST number, commission and insurance with its expiry date.
2. Open a partner for its cars, bookings, statements, payouts and documents. A warning shows when its insurance expires soon, and Staff tasks gets a reminder (Program settings sets how many days before).
3. Banking (Admins only): **Save the payout account** for the account we pay the partner into. The account number is stored encrypted. Press **Verify** once checked.
4. Portal: **Invite to the owner portal** gives the partner the owner portal with its cars, bookings, statements and the partner agreement, filled in and signed on screen in three taps.
5. Signed on paper? Press **Print the partner agreement**, then record the signed scan under Record a paper signature.

## A partner fleet on its own rates

Some partners send a price sheet of their own rates instead of sharing what the renter pays. 01 Motors works this way: its whole fleet is on the site, and staff manage its cars (it has no portal sign-in yet; add its email on the partner page and invite it later).

1. **People** > **Partners** > the partner. **Pricing** shows how it is paid: the renter pays the partner''s sheet rate plus the markup (10% unless you set another), rounded to the nearest dollar; CarmaCars keeps the markup plus its cut (20% of the sheet rate); the partner is owed the rest of its sheet rate. Press **Edit pricing** to change the markup, the cut or the basis for every car at once.
2. **Cars** lists each car with its sheet rates a day (1 to 2 days, 3 or more, 7 or more) and the renter''s rates. Press **Edit** on a car to change a negotiated rate, give that car its own markup or cut, mark it **Insurance included** or **No credit card needed**, or confirm its model year. The renter''s rates change at once.
3. The site shows these cars with their tiers (1 to 2 days, 3 to 6 days, 7 days or more) and "Guideline rates; final price confirmed after review". A car with insurance included needs no coverage choice from the renter (coverage option 4, confirmed by itself); a car with no credit card needed takes a debit card for the payment and the deposit. The deposit, the licence and identity checks and the ages stay the same.
4. The price sheet has no years, VINs or plates. Until you confirm the year, the site leaves it out and says "Year confirmed when you book"; an offer waits until the year is confirmed (Edit on the car, Model year). Add the plate and the VIN on the car''s page before its first handover.
5. Real photos: open the car (its name in Cars), **Photos**, and add them. Once approved they replace the eight studio stand-ins.

> Good to know: The partner''s monthly statement shows each rental at the sheet rate, the cut and the payout; never what the renter paid. A refund lowers the partner''s share in proportion; a discount CarmaCars gives comes out of the markup.

## A partner''s CRM (01 Motors'' GoHighLevel)

**Settings**, the **Partners** tile, then the partner (or **CRM link** on the partner''s page). Their CRM gets our cars, kept up to date, and their cars come to us.

1. Ask the partner for a Private Integration token and their location ID (the box **What 01 Motors gives us** on the page says exactly what to create and which scopes to tick). Paste both and press **Connect**. The token goes to the vault; the page only ever shows its last four characters.
2. Connect tests the link (their location, objects, products and pipelines) and runs the first sync. After that it runs by itself every 15 minutes, and within five minutes of a change to a car, a rate, a photo, a booking or a block. **Test connection** and **Run sync now** do it at once.
3. **What 01 Motors sees**: CarmaCars'' own cars and program owners'' cars that are on the site, with rates, the next 60 days and photos, as records of a "CarmaCars Vehicles" object in their CRM (or as products when their plan has no custom objects). Partner cars are never sent: not theirs, not another partner''s. Press **Change what we share** to leave out program owners'' cars, rates, availability or photos.
4. **Partner price**: the site''s rates, or the site''s rates less (or plus) a percentage, to the nearest dollar.
5. **Their cars coming in**: name the object in their CRM that holds their cars (Test connection lists them), or their feed address. Each of their cars is matched to their car here, or added as their partner car (it waits off the site unless you choose otherwise), with their rates as its sheet rates, their booked dates as calendar blocks and their photos for a car with none. A car that waits shows **Add as their car**, **Link** or **Set aside**.
6. **Leads both ways** (off until you turn it on): requests for their cars, and requests that came through their booking links, become contacts and opportunities in the pipeline stage you choose; an opportunity they move to the stage you name becomes a lead in **Leads**.
7. **Feed, widget and booking links**: a JSON or CSV feed and a widget for their GoHighLevel funnels and sites (copy the iframe), and booking links carmacars.ca/p/01-motors/<car> that mark the request as theirs for 30 days. **New key** ends the old feed and widget addresses at once.

> Good to know: A link that has failed for an hour shows on Admin > Today. Disconnect deletes the token from the vault; what is already in their CRM stays there.

## Add a rental by hand

**Bookings** > **Add a rental**. For phone, walk-in, Turo, partner and insurer bookings, the owner using their own car, and placeholders: a rental already agreed. To send an offer instead, use Send an offer.

1. Quick start sets the usual choices in one tap: **Phone**, **Walk-in**, **Turo or another platform**, **Insurance replacement**, **Owner using own car** or **Placeholder**.
2. Choose the car and the dates. The calendar and the price are checked by themselves: clashes with other bookings and the cleaning time after each trip. An Admin may book over a clash with a reason.
3. The dates decide the case, shown under them (nothing to tick): a pickup ahead is an upcoming rental, handed over at pickup as usual. A pickup already passed with the return ahead is a rental already underway: it is recorded as on trip from the pickup you enter, on any active car (even one closed to public bookings), and anything a handover checks that is still missing (signature, licence check, coverage proof, deposit, condition report, insurance) becomes a task. A return already passed is a rental that has ended: kept as completed, paid another way or unpaid.
4. Find the renter by name, email or phone, or add a new one: name, email, phone, date of birth and licence. Add any other drivers.
5. Check the price: every line of the price can be changed where it stands. Type a new amount in the line (the rental charge for the trip or a rate a day, the young driver fee, the Protection Plan, delivery, each add-on, the deposit, the kilometres a day); HST and the total follow. Add a line from the list or a charge of its own; Remove takes a fee off. The (i) beside each line says what it is and how it is worked out. One optional reason covers all the changes.
6. Any length: the dates may run past 30 days (up to the staff limit in Program settings, 730 days by default). From 30 days the rental charge is the monthly rate for each 30 days, and the monthly periods are listed.
7. A car whose listing is not finished (a draft listing, onboarding, no photos or no rates yet) can be rented at once: it shows Listing not finished in the car list and stays off the public site. With no rates yet, type the rental charge for the whole rental and the reason.
8. An owner''s car that is not on the fleet insurance policy yet: only an Admin adds its rentals, and ticks I checked that this car is insured for this rental. An owner''s car needs its terms (Revenue Share) first. The handover still needs the car on the fleet policy: press **Insurer confirmed** once the insurer confirms it.
9. The rent is paid by: e-Transfer or cash (received), card on file (charged when the renter signs), payment link, platform payout (Turo), insurer billed later, cheque, bank transfer, or unpaid. Paid in parts (some cash, some e-Transfer): press **Add another payment (paid in parts)** and type each amount. Then the deposit, its own way: card hold, cash, e-Transfer (with its reference and date) or no deposit.
10. Before you save checks it all in one box: the renter, the car, the days, the total, what was received and what is still to collect, the deposit and the agreement.
11. The rental agreement: Send it to sign online, or Already signed on paper (a task asks for the scan). The calendar: untick Blocks the car''s calendar for an insurance replacement with dates not known yet, with the reason.
12. Tick **Do not email the renter** if they should not get the confirmation. Press **Add the rental**.

> Tip: The rental is on the calendars at once (a payment link waits for the payment). The renter signs the rental agreement in their portal, or on paper and you record it. With the saved card, nothing is charged when you add the rental: the card is charged when the renter presses Accept and sign, and until then the rental is awaiting signature. On the booking, **Verified in person** records a licence checked at the counter. A rental already underway can be paid by payment link (the renter signs, then pays from their booking) or the saved card, like an upcoming one.

## Retire or delete a car

**Cars** > **Retire or delete**, or the car''s own page.

1. **Retire this car** takes the car off the site and the calendars and keeps every record. It needs no future confirmed booking. **Restore** brings it back.
2. **Delete this car** removes a car added by mistake, with its photos. Only a car with nothing tied to money (no confirmed or paid booking, payment, statement, toll or damage). Type the plate or the name to confirm.
3. Booking requests that never confirmed and never took money (requested, offered, declined, expired) do not stop a delete. The confirmation lists them; they are removed with the car and a copy is kept. The renters stay on file.
4. On the same page, **Delete all sample cars** deletes every sample car that meets the rule at once, with its requests. Type DELETE SAMPLE CARS to confirm; the ones kept show why, with the booking numbers.

## Sample cars on the site

**Cars** > **Vehicles**, or **Settings** > **Site**. The 20 example cars the site started with, so the fleet never looks empty while the real cars are listed.

1. **Hide sample cars** asks first ("Hide all 20 sample cars from the site?"); press **Hide them** to take every sample car off the site at once, or **Keep them**. Nothing else stops it: not an enquiry, not an old request.
2. **Show sample cars** puts the 20 back, with their photos and rates. Ones that were deleted are made again.
3. On the site each one is marked "Example car". They never appear in search engines or the sitemap.
4. A request on a sample car is never a booking. When the person picks dates, the car page and the request form show a real car free for them (the same make and model first, else the same class and body at a similar price) with one tap to switch to it. If they keep the sample car, it becomes an enquiry (number EQ-1001 and up) and customer service gets the task Suggest a similar real car, naming the free real car.

> Tip: Hide the sample cars once enough real cars are on the site. Delete all sample cars removes them for good.

## Why a car is not on the site yet

**Cars** > **Vehicles**, the card Not on the site yet.

1. Every real car that is not on the site is listed with its next step first: the rates, Publish now, the listing review.
2. The same car is a line on To do with **Set rates and publish**. The car comes off both once it is on the site.
3. A car without photos is marked sample photos: once listed it shows a sample photo until its real photos are approved.

## Tolls when two rentals overlap

Bookings held for an insurer and other placeholders are never matched to a toll. When two real rentals overlap the toll time, nobody is charged automatically: the toll waits in the work queue under Two rentals, with both bookings, and you choose who pays.
', 'Partners, company cars and rentals added by hand', 'Add a car, partners, add a rental, retire or delete a car, sample cars and tolls with two rentals.',
  'A car comes from one of three places: a program owner, CarmaCars itself, or a partner rental company. You add cars and rentals by hand, retire cars, and delete cars that were added by mistake.

## Add a car

**Cars** > **Vehicles**, then **Add a car**. Start with the VIN: everything else about the car comes from it.

2. When the VIN fits several trims, the form asks which trim it is: press the one on the car''s papers or badge, or **Not sure** (Admin > Today asks again).
3. No VIN at hand? Press **No VIN at hand? Add the car by its plate** and choose the year, make and model from the lists. The VIN can be added later; the details fill in then.

7. The daily rate is filled in from similar cars, else the class. Keep it, change it, or empty it and set the rates later on the car''s Rates tab. Press **Add the car**.

> Tip: The title, description and features are written by themselves right after the car is added, from the VIN details. Change any of them on the car''s listing; a field you change is kept.

> Good to know: Every car gets a fleet number and its standard settings the moment it is added: a complete rate card (the daily rate you typed or the suggested one, weekend, weekly and monthly from it, the kilometres a day, the extra kilometre rate, the deposit and the delivery and pickup fee of its class) and drivers 18 to 20 allowed. Each value set this way says (Set automatically) on the car''s Overview and Rates tab until you change it. The defaults come from Settings: Program and Fee defaults.

Bookings held for an insurer and other placeholders are never matched to a toll. When two real rentals overlap the toll time, nobody is charged automatically: the toll waits in the work queue under Two rentals, with both bookings, and you choose who pays.

## An enquiry on an example car

Some cars on the site are marked "Example car": samples that show the kind of cars we rent. A request on one is an enquiry, never a booking.

1. The task Suggest a similar real car comes to To do with the enquiry number (EQ-1001 and up), the car asked for, the dates and the contact. When a real car was free for those dates, the task names it after **Free:** (the same make and model first, else the same class and body at a similar price), and the person was told we have a similar car and will confirm it within 2 hours.

3. Call or email the person with the car and the price, then mark the task done.

> Tip: Reply within the first reply target, as for any request. Never offer the example car itself: it does not exist.

## A request from a vehicle page

Every make, model, year and trim page (carmacars.ca/cars/toyota/rav4/2023/xle, for example) has Request it, for the exact car the person wants.

1. The request arrives as an enquiry with the car named in the message ("About the car: 2023 Toyota RAV4 XLE") and an Enquiry task in To do.
2. If we have that car, or one close to it, free for their dates, make a **New quote** for it. If not, suggest the nearest car of the same kind and price.
3. Reply by email or phone, then mark the task done.

> Tip: The pages say only what the data says: EPA fuel use, the Canadian trims and our own cars. Never promise equipment the page does not list.

## A buyer lead from a /buy page

Every vehicle page has a for-sale twin (carmacars.ca/buy/toyota/rav4/2023/xle) with "Find me this car", and twins for financing, detailing and body shop work with their own request: a name, an email or phone, and when.

1. The lead is in **Owner leads** (customer service: **Owners and enquiries**), Buyer leads (kind buyer, finance, detailing or body shop), with the car and what they asked, and a To do line for Sales: A buyer asked us to find a car, Someone asked about financing or leasing a car, A detailing request, or A body shop request.
2. If one of our cars of that kind is for sale (an Admin flags it with its price), offer it. If not, offer to rent them the car for a week first, and say what we can find. We do not lend or lease: on a financing question, say so and offer the rental. For detailing or body shop work, give a time and a price, and always offer a rental while their car is in (an insurance replacement rental when it is a claim). For mechanical work (a "Mechanical work to arrange" task: an oil change, brakes, tires, a tow and the like), CarmaCars does not do the work: book it with a trusted shop or recommend one, never promise the shop''s price or time, and offer a rental while their car is in.
3. Press **Take it**, then **Update** as you go: contacted, qualified, converted or closed with the reason.

> Tip: We mostly rent cars. Never say a car is for sale unless an Admin flagged it; the page shows it with its price when one is.

3. One is wrong? Open **Reject this one** under it, type the reason the renter reads and press **Reject**.
4. Then press **Approve all**: everything still waiting is approved at once (the Protection Plan too). A document the system refuses is named with the reason; the rest are approved.

> Tip: Each opening is logged. An Admin can do the same from Admin > To do.

## Which credit cards include rental car coverage?

Renters ask this often. **Renters** > **Card coverage** (every function has it under Rentals or Bookings) is your quick reference: what to say, what to check, and the list.

1. Send the renter `carmacars.ca/credit-card-rental-coverage`: each card''s car value limit (MSRP), longest rental, key exclusions, its official guide and the day we last checked it.
2. Ask which car they want. Most Canadian cards stop at a car priced $65,000 or $85,000, and many luxury models are priced higher. Give them the car''s model year and trim so they can check.
3. Never tell a renter they are covered. Their card''s issuer decides that: ask them to call the number on the back of their card about this car and these dates. CarmaCars does not decide claims.
4. Over the limit, an excluded make, a debit card or a longer rental than the card allows: offer OPCF 27 on their own auto policy or the CarmaCars Protection Plan.

> Tip: A card marked Unverified came from a published summary, not the issuer''s guide. Something wrong or out of date in the list? Tell an Admin: they correct it in Settings > Card coverage.

2. The renter should be asked now anyway? Press **Send anyway**. Should never be asked? Press **Do not ask**.
3. Google reviews: a possible match to a renter shows "possible match". Press **Confirm** if it is them, **Not this renter** if not, or **Match to a booking** with the booking number.
4. On a booking, the card Review requests has **Ask for a review** (for example after a call that went well) and **Mark reviewed** when the renter says they already left one.

> Tip: Never offer anything for a review and never ask only happy renters: everyone gets the same message and the same Google link.

## A change to a confirmed booking

On a booking''s Changes tab you can propose new dates, times or another car, as an Admin does: set the change, write the reason, press **Preview the price**, then **Send to the renter**. The renter has 48 hours to accept and sign the amendment. You also send a new signing link to an additional driver from the booking screen.

## Add a rental

Open **Bookings** > **Add a rental**. Your home address must be in your profile first: until it is, the page asks for it.

1. Choose the car, the dates and the places. The check shows any clash with another booking or with the cleaning time after a trip. You cannot book over a clash: ask an Admin.
2. The dates decide the case, shown under them. Car already out with the renter? Enter the pickup as when it left: the rental is recorded as on trip, and anything still missing (signature, licence check, coverage proof, deposit) becomes a task. A rental that has already ended is recorded by an Admin.
3. Find the renter by name, email or phone, or add a new one with their name, email, phone, date of birth and licence. Add any other drivers.
4. The calendar and the price are checked by themselves once the car and the dates are in. The price comes from the rate sheet. You may add the extras, how damage is covered and an allowed promo code.
5. Quick start: **Phone**, **Walk-in**, **Turo or another platform** or **Insurance replacement** sets the usual choices.
6. A car tagged Listing not finished can be rented too: it stays off the public site. If it has no rates yet, type the rental charge for the whole rental and the reason. An owner''s car not yet on the fleet insurance policy is added by an Admin only.
7. Every line of the price can be changed where it stands (customer service and sales, while Program settings allow it): the rental charge for the trip or a rate a day, the young driver fee, the Protection Plan, delivery, each add-on, the kilometres a day; add a fee from the list or a charge of its own. The (i) beside each line says what it is. The rate-sheet price stays on the booking; a price far under it is flagged for an Admin, never refused.
8. Any length: past 30 days the monthly rate applies for each 30 days, and the monthly periods are listed.
9. Choose how the rent is paid (e-Transfer or cash received, card on file, payment link, platform payout, insurer billed later; the ways open to you are set by an Admin; paid in parts: Add another payment) and then how the deposit is paid (card hold, cash or e-Transfer with its reference). Before you save sums it all up. Signed on paper already? Choose it: a task asks for the scan. An insurance replacement with dates not known yet: untick Blocks the car''s calendar and say why.
10. Under Who found this client, choose **I sourced this client** or **Entered for CarmaCars**.
11. Press **Add the rental**. The renter gets the confirmation email unless you tick **Do not email the renter**.
12. A rental you add is credited to you and shows in My sales as a rental you added. If you sourced it, its commission shows there too.

> Tip: The renter signs the rental agreement in their portal before pickup. With the saved card, nothing is charged when you add the rental: the card is charged when the renter presses Accept and sign. If they sign on paper at the counter, an Admin records it. A payment link keeps the booking waiting for payment.

## Add a rental

Open **Bookings** > **Add a rental**. Your home address must be in your profile first: until it is, the page asks for it.

1. At pickup with the renter? Press **Start at pickup**: the renter''s name and phone, the car, the kilometres and the fuel, then **Hold the car and finish later**. The car is held for 2 hours and you get a task to finish it.
2. Nothing is required to save: the form is saved as a draft as you type (**Save draft** saves at once). Unfinished rentals, on Today and on this page, opens a draft where it was left, on any device. Tick Hold the car while I finish to keep the car off the calendar while you type.

10. Any length: past 30 days the monthly rate applies for each 30 days, and the monthly periods are listed. Each later period gets its own agreement, sent to the renter to sign a few days before it starts (Monthly periods on the booking; Send the agreement for the next period now if needed).
11. Choose how the rent is paid (e-Transfer or cash received, card on file, payment link, platform payout, insurer billed later; the ways open to you are set by an Admin; paid in parts: Add another payment) and then how the deposit is paid (card hold, cash or e-Transfer with its reference).

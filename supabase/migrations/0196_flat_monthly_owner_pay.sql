-- 0196_flat_monthly_owner_pay.sql: a flat monthly payment per car for the owner. SCHEMA_MARKER 0196.
-- Record: docs/changes/2026-10-30-flat-monthly-owner-pay.md. The owner, October 30, 2026: "Some cohosts don't care for
-- monthly splits or paying us for insurance; they just want a monthly payment per car. We need a way to reflect that."
--
-- 1. vehicle_owner_arrangements: per car, a flat monthly payment (the amount a month, from a date, to an optional last
--    day), kept as history: a change ends the period in force the day before and starts a new one; a period that has
--    not started is cancelled, never deleted. No period on a day: the car's revenue share terms apply, as before.
--    Set by an Admin from the car's owner terms (app.car_pay_set). A change never reaches a month whose owner statement
--    is approved or paid, so an approved statement never changes.
-- 2. The rentals: a booking part that counts on a day of a flat period (its counts_on, the day it ends) stays with
--    CarmaCars: the split's company share is 100% (company_share_bps 10000, owner payout 0), so the company accounts
--    and reports keep the whole rental, and a later refund or extra charge on it never reaches the owner. A Turo trip
--    ending on such a day likewise (its terms' share kept in turo_trips.terms_share_bps, put back if the period goes).
-- 3. Booking expenses on such a booking are not passed to the owner, unless an Admin marks the expense "charge to
--    owner": it then becomes an owner cost (owner_deductions kind booking_expense) on the statement of that booking.
--    The owner costs CarmaCars records on the owner's account (tickets, tolls, damage shortfalls of the owner's own use,
--    agreed costs) stay as they are: they are the owner's own costs, whatever the pay arrangement.
-- 4. The payment: each month of a period is an owner credit (kind flat_monthly) on the statement of that month, a
--    "Flat monthly payment" line, part months by the day (the days of the period inside the month, within the car's
--    Enrollment Date and Exit Date). Worked out again on each build of a draft; settled with the statement like any
--    credit. The rental lines of the car show the booking with no Owner Revenue and no Revenue Share.
-- 5. Fees: no Insurance Fee or Tracker Fee for the days of a flat period (a month all flat has no monthly invoice; a
--    part month is billed for the other days only).
-- 6. Reads: the car's terms (Admin and owner portal) carry "pay"; the booking's owner deductions carry the flat period
--    and "charge to owner"; the owner's booking rows list only the expenses charged to them on a flat car.
-- 7. The door, privileges, the guides.
-- No earlier migration is edited. Functions it changes are wrapped (renamed _pre0196) or replaced with the same signature.

## How your fees work

- Each car has two monthly fees: an insurance fee and a tracker fee. They are due every month, rented or not.
- The tracker fee starts the day the car''s tracker is installed. The tracker install fee has its own invoice.
- Before a car goes live you pay the first and last month amount we agreed with you (usually two months of the insurance fee, or the exact amount we agreed).
- Your amounts are the ones we agreed for each car, to the cent. Any other fee we agreed, for example a registration fee, comes on its own invoice with each line, its quantity and whether HST applies.
- Vehicles shows each car''s terms: the insurance fee and tracker fee a month and the Revenue Share, since when they apply, and any change coming. Open a car for its History: every period of terms and every notice we sent (Download the notice).
- Lower amounts apply from the date in our notice. A higher fee comes with 30 days'' written notice; a higher Revenue Share applies only if you sign an updated Vehicle Schedule. A month whose fee changes part way is billed per day at each amount.
- One invoice per car. Registry, inspection and appraisal costs are not billed by us unless we agreed to pay them for you; then they are on an invoice of their own.

An invoice we cancel shows Void with the reason, and the invoice that replaces it. Nothing is debited for a void invoice. Every invoice has Download PDF.

## The monthly debit, step by step

Notice day | 10 days before: your invoices and one email with the total
The 15th | Each invoice is debited from your account
Cleared | The invoice shows Paid and you get a receipt
Insufficient funds? | A $50.00 Late Fee once, and the same amount tried again within 30 days
:::

- A debit is never more than its notice said. Each invoice shows "will be debited on" with the date.
- If your bank returns a debit for insufficient funds, we add the $50.00 Late Fee to that invoice once and try the original amount again within 30 days, as section 4.4 of your Enrollment Agreement sets out. The Late Fee is collected with your next debit.
- Returned for another reason (for example a closed account)? We do not try again and add no Late Fee. We pause your debit and email you: pay the invoice from its page, or set up a new account under Account > Banking.
- Returned again after the retry? The invoice is in arrears and we contact you.
- You can always pay an invoice by card from its page before the debit day.
- On your bank statement the debit shows our company''s legal name, operating as CarmaCars.

## Sign everything at once

Everything you sign on screen is in one place: Home shows how many are signed ("2 of 5 signed") and opens it with Check and sign.

1. Press **Check and sign** on Home (or open `carmacars.ca/owner/sign`). The list at the top shows each document: signed, in this package, or done elsewhere (Forms C and D, the bank debit).
2. Check the key values: your name, address, each car with its VIN and plate, your fees and Revenue Share. Something wrong? Press **Fix** next to it, change it, and come back.
3. Open any document to read it word for word: the agreements, the schedules and Forms A and B. The official registry forms are not in it: they are printed and signed in ink.
4. Press **Send the code**: a 6-digit code goes to your phone (or your email, if you choose it). Type it and press **Confirm**.
5. Tick that you read the documents, draw your initials in the box beside each confirmation the Enrollment Agreement asks for, and tick the two consents (to sign electronically, to get your records electronically).
6. Draw your signature in the box with your finger, a pen or the mouse, then press **Sign all**. One signature is applied to each document; CarmaCars countersigns at the same moment and every signed copy is in Documents.
7. Each signed copy ends with a certificate of completion: when and where each step was done, and the code that confirmed it was you. Anyone holding a copy can check it at carmacars.ca/verify.

## Read your agreements before approval

You can read both agreements as soon as you apply, before we approve your terms.

1. Press **Read your agreements** on Home (Documents and each car''s Onboarding checklist link to it too).
2. Each document is filled in from your application: your name, address and cars. It is marked "Terms pending approval": the fees, the Revenue Share and the agreement numbers read Pending approval until we set them.
3. Something wrong? Press **Fix** next to it. The Sign button stays off until we approve your terms; then Home shows **Check and sign** and we email you.

> Two owners: A car with a second owner on its ownership? Each owner named in the Title Schedule signs. The other owner gets their own link by email and signs the same documents on their phone or computer, the same way: the code (sent to their email), the confirmations initialled, the consents and their drawn signature. The agreements take effect when the last owner signs; CarmaCars countersigns then.

> Good to know: Cannot draw a signature (for example with a disability)? Call us: an Admin can let you type your name instead.

> Good to know: Form A (the trust declaration) is for cars under the Co-Registrant or Transfer method; Form B (the lease summary) for cars under a Lease method. No witness is needed: they are in the same package. You can also sign one on its own page from Documents.

> Tip: Signed one of your documents on paper instead? Send us the scan. Once we record it, Documents shows it as Signed on paper and we do not ask again.

## We set up your car for you

When our team enters your car for you, you get one email: review the details and sign.

1. No sign-in yet? The email has a link to choose your password. It works once, for 24 hours; after that use Forgot password on the sign-in page.
2. Open `carmacars.ca/owner/review` (Home has **Review or correct your details**). Check your phone and address, and each car: plate, colour, odometer, your insurer and your lender. The terms we agreed are shown too.
3. Something wrong? Correct it and press **Save corrections**. Your documents are filled in again and we are told. A term you did not agree to: message us before you sign.
4. Everything right? Press **Everything is right: sign** and sign once.

## Sign an updated Vehicle Schedule

When we agree new terms for a car you already signed for, you sign an updated Vehicle Schedule. Home shows it first.

1. Open it from Home or the email. It shows what changes (now and updated) and the date it applies from.
2. Read the text, then sign the same way as your agreements: the code to your phone or email, tick that you read it, initial the updated terms, tick the two consents, draw your signature and press **Sign**.
3. Your current terms stay until you sign. After that, your invoices and statements use the new ones from the date. The signed copy, with its certificate of completion, is in Documents.

## Form C on screen, with your witness beside you

Form C is the lender or lessor permission for a financed or leased car. It needs one witness, and you can sign it on screen when your witness is with you.

1. Open Documents. Under Forms to sign with witnesses, press Sign Form C on screen instead.
2. Confirm it is you with the code sent to your phone or email, and tick that you read the form.
3. Draw your initials beside each of the three acknowledgments, tick the two consents and draw your signature.
4. Hand the device to your witness, another adult. They type their full name and tick the statement "I witnessed (your name) sign in my presence." Press **Sign Form C**.

## Forms C and D on paper, signed with witnesses

Form D is a limited power of attorney (two witnesses), signed on paper. Form C can be signed on paper too, with one witness.

1. Open Documents. Under Forms to sign with witnesses, press **Print the form**. It is filled in, and every spot to sign or initial is marked SIGN HERE or INITIAL HERE.
2. Sign it in front of your witnesses. They sign and print their names in their spots.
3. Type each witness''s full name in the boxes.
4. On your phone, press **Take a photo of the signed page**: one photo of each page. A PDF scan works too (**Or choose a file**).

> Tip: We check the photo and approve it, or send it back with what to fix. You get an email either way, and the page shows the status.

> Good to know: Why paper for Form D? It is a power of attorney, which cannot be signed electronically in Ontario, and its two witnesses sign in person.

## Government forms filled for you

Each car''s registry forms are prepared from your records, only the ones its onboarding method needs (013-1155 and 013-0169, for example, only for a Lease through a new corporation). Until we load the official PDF, you get a data sheet with the values.

1. Open Documents and choose a form marked "Official form, filled for you".
2. Press **Download the filled form** and check each value.
3. Print it and sign it in ink. It is the official ServiceOntario form exactly as ServiceOntario publishes it, with only its empty text boxes filled in. Its boxes to tick and its signatures are done by hand, at the registry office or before you go, as we tell you.

> Good to know: ON00453 (a company''s registrant number) is an Adobe form: open it in Adobe Acrobat Reader (free) to see and print it. Other PDF viewers show a blank page, as they do with the form downloaded from ServiceOntario.

> Watch out: Official registry forms are never signed on screen. You pay ServiceOntario, the inspection station and the appraiser directly.

select app.guide_release_section('admin', 'requests-offers-and-bookings', 'chapter', 'people-and-access', 'A booking starts as a request from the website, or as an offer you send yourself to a customer on the phone. You check it, adjust it and send the offer; an offer that is out is changed in place. After that, the booking page holds the money, documents, changes and history.

## The request queue

Open **Bookings** > **Requests**. The oldest waiting request is at the top.

1. Filter by New, Waiting on the renter, Pushed back, Offer out, Signing and payment, or Offer expired.
2. Waiting shows how long the renter has waited; red means past the first reply target (5 minutes, set in Program settings). Open a booking number to answer it.

![](/guides/img/admin-02-requests-desktop-6521282d.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 820; address: carmacars.ca/admin/requests; pins: 1 38.9 29.9, 2 22.2 43.3")

> Good to know: A request whose pickup time passes without an offer expires by itself, with a note in its history. The renter is not emailed unless "Email the renter when their request expires that way" is on in Program settings.

## Answer a request with an offer

1. The Review and offer tab shows the request as the renter sent it.
2. Adjust the car, the dates, the rate type, the places, the rates and fees, the deposit and extras.
3. Price on the right updates as you change things.
4. Add a message, choose how long the offer stays open, then press **Send the offer**.

![](/guides/img/admin-03-booking-review-desktop-353f3707.jpg "desktop; size: 1200 1550; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10069?tab=review; pins: 1 5.0 6.5, 2 7.5 45.8, 3 74.2 42.6, 4 76.7 98.1")

5. Changed fields but not ready to send? Press **Save changes**. The panel "The offer as the renter sees it" shows the result.
6. Can''t do it? Press **Decline** and fill in Reason and any alternative.
7. Need an answer first? Press **Ask the renter** to send a question.

![](/guides/img/admin-03-booking-review-desktop-4dd4ed06.jpg "desktop; size: 500 80; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10069?tab=review; pins: 6 41.2 52.5, 7 18.0 52.5")

Opening a request takes it for you: everyone else sees "Being answered by" your name and since when, with Send the offer and Decline off, until you send, decline or leave (20 minutes, renewed while you work; Program settings). Press **Take over** to answer one someone else holds; it is noted in the history. A second answer is refused with who answered and when. A request from the website opens to Sales after 15 minutes (Program settings); until then Admins, customer service and fleet answer it.

## Send an offer without a request

**Bookings** > **Send an offer**, or **Send an offer** on Bookings and on Requests. For a customer on the phone, by text or at the counter: no request needed.

1. The customer: type a name, phone or email and choose them. Not on file? Press **Add a new customer**: full legal name, mobile, email (the offer link goes there) and date of birth. A customer already on file with the same email or phone is shown with Use: one person, one record.
2. The car and the dates: type the car code, plate or name, or choose from the list; each car says Free or Not free for the dates. Then the pickup and return places (our location, delivery with the address and distance, airport).
3. The price: the Rate sheet, A total for the whole rental, or A rate per day (times the days). A price typed by hand needs its reason. At the top of the price, Amounts I type: Before tax, or After tax (HST included) to type what the renter pays for each line, worked back to the amount before tax for you (a line without HST stays as typed; the choice is remembered on this device). Or type the Total the renter pays (after tax): the rental charge is worked out so the total comes to it exactly, the other lines kept. Set the kilometres, a promo code, the deposit, a discount and each fee (an Admin), and how damage is covered: with option 3 the Protection Plan price is the one the renter pays.
4. How it is paid: the rental by card online (the usual way), e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout or the insurer; the deposit by card hold, cash, e-Transfer or no deposit (an Admin).
5. Who found this client, the message to the renter, how long the offer is open, and how the link goes: Email, Text, both or neither.
6. The right side is the offer as the renter will see it, priced by the database as you type. Press **Send the offer**. **Save without sending** keeps it as a request for later.

> Good to know: It makes the same request and offer the website makes: the renter approves, signs and pays (or you record the payment), and only then is the car on the calendar. No "request received" email goes to the renter for an offer you send. Staff commissions and statements count it like any other booking.

## Change an offer that is out

The renter has the offer (Offered), or approved it and has not paid (Signing and payment). Press **Edit the offer** on the booking.

1. Change anything: the car, the dates, the places, the price, fees, the deposit, add-ons, how it is paid. Each changed field is highlighted and the before and after are listed. Amounts I type (Before tax or After tax) and the Total the renter pays (after tax) work as on Send an offer.
2. Write what changed in Message to the renter and choose how long the offer is open.
3. Press **Save and send the update**: the renter gets the new version by email or text (ticked), and the old version no longer counts. Or press **Save without telling the renter** and tell them yourself.
4. A confirmed booking is changed with **Change the booking** (Propose a change, below).

> Tip: No need to withdraw first. **Withdraw the offer** is only for taking it back for good; **Send again, later expiry** gives the renter more time, and **Renter approved by phone** records a yes given on a call.

## Edit a booking that has started

On a confirmed, on-trip or returned booking (an Admin: a closed one too), Overview, **Edit the booking**, **Edit**.

1. Change the pickup or the return (extend or shorten: the rental charge is worked out again at this booking''s rates), the car (on trip: the car it leaves goes to Out of service for Fleet to check), the rental charge for the trip, each fee, the kilometres a day, the deposit (an Admin) and the note.
2. Type why, if you like, and tick **Email the renter what changed**, or leave it off for a silent correction. Press **Save the changes**.
3. What is open now shows at once: **Email a pay link** or **Text a pay link** for exactly that amount, **Charge** the saved card (the renter agreed), or record cash or an e-Transfer on the Money tab.

> Good to know: Each edit is kept with who, when, why, before and after (Edits, under the form) and in the booking''s history. A closed booking''s owner split and the staff commission follow. To have the renter accept and sign first, use Propose a change instead.

## Fees, a forgotten fee and the balance

On the booking''s Money tab, Fees lists each fee. Press **Change or add a fee**.

1. Type a new amount (for the whole trip, before HST) beside any fee, or choose one not on the booking (the young driver fee shows its price for these dates), or add a charge of its own with or without HST.
2. Press **Save the fees**. The balance shows by part (rental, fees) with the pay link, the saved card and Record a payment beside it.
3. The renter sees the balance on their booking with a Pay button, and pays by card on Stripe''s form.

> Good to know: Every change is recorded (Changes to the fees): the amount before and after, who and why. Customer service and sales may change fees while Program settings, Staff may change fees, is on.

## Correct a renter''s details

On the renter''s page (People, Renters) or on any of their bookings, **Edit renter**.

1. Correct the name, email, phone, date of birth, licence, home address (start typing to find it) or the staff note.
2. A new email also becomes their sign-in at once (no confirmation needed for a typo you correct); tick **Email the renter a link to set a password** to send one there. Unsigned agreements and offers go to the new address.
3. Press **Save the renter**. An email that another renter has is refused with their name; the same phone is a warning.
4. The same person entered twice? Possible duplicates (same email, same phone, or same name and date of birth) shows under the renter. **Merge into this record** moves the other record''s bookings, licences, cards, payments, documents and messages here and fills any detail missing here; the other record stays, blocked, with the merge in both histories.

## Payments by part: the rental, the deposit and later charges

On the booking''s Money tab, Money by part shows what is still open for the rental, the fees and later charges, the deposit and the card on file. Each part is paid its own way, in any mix: for example the deposit in cash and the rental by card.

1. **Record a payment**: choose what it is for (the rental, fees, the deposit or a later charge) and how it was paid (e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout, the insurer). An e-Transfer, cheque or transfer needs its reference. Press **Record it**. The renter gets a receipt; **Print** prints one to hand over.
2. **Collect a card**: a payment (Everything open by default: the rental, the fees and any later charge in one), the deposit hold or saving the card. The renter types the card in Stripe''s secure form: on this device (**Open the card form**, then hand it over) or by a link texted or emailed to them (**Send the link**). Staff never type a card number.
3. A deposit hold lasts about 7 days and shows the days left; while the car is out it is collected by itself before it lapses. After the return, settle the deposit (below). **Capture the hold** for all of it keeps the money; a part capture or **Release the hold** waits for the settlement while the car is out or something is open (an Admin may do it with the reason).
4. **Charge the saved card** (Finance or an Admin): extra kilometres, fuel, damage or a late return, with the reason the renter''s receipt shows. For a rental over 7 days, save the card and charge the deposit this way.
5. An offer paid another way: once the renter approved and signed and the money is recorded, the booking is confirmed (or press **Confirm the booking**).
6. A deposit taken in cash or by e-Transfer is given back the same way after the return: Finance gets a task; press **Returned** with the reference or receipt number.

> Good to know: Statements, reconciliation and the deposit settlement read each payment with its method: a cash deposit is never refunded to a card.

## Settle the deposit

The deposit is never given back by itself. Finance or an Admin settles it after the return: on the booking''s Money tab, under Deposit, press **Settle the deposit**. Issue the Check-in statement first.

1. The form shows the deposit, what is still available, the charges owed from the statement and what is taken from the deposit for them. What the deposit does not cover is charged to the card on file; with no card (or a card declined), the renter gets a pay link by email and text, and Finance has a task until it is paid.
2. Tolls and tickets can take up to 7 days to come in. Inside that window the whole rest of the deposit is filled in as the hold-back, until the window ends. To give it back sooner, tick Release now anyway: a toll that comes in later is charged to the card on file.
3. Something still open keeps the whole deposit: an incident, a claim, new damage at the return not priced, damage found later not billed, a toll or ticket on the car during the rental not matched or not charged, a card dispute, or charges not on a statement yet. The form lists them. Only an Admin can release part of it, with the reason; it is recorded.
4. Damage: **Keep the whole deposit (damage)** turns what is left of the deposit into a damage charge, with what was damaged and the photos; the renter is told. **Bill damage** adds a damage charge up to the $2,500 deductible (more goes through a claim): the deposit pays first, then the card on file.
5. Press **Settle**. The money moves at Stripe at once: the charges are collected and what is not owed is refunded or the hold released. A step Stripe refuses is tried again by itself, and Finance gets a task if it keeps failing.

> Good to know: A card hold lapses after about 7 days. While the car is out, or returned and not settled, the hold is collected in full a day and a half before it lapses: that keeps the money, and the settlement refunds what is not owed. A hold that lapses anyway is charged to the saved card, and Finance is told at once.

## A booking

Open **Bookings** > **Bookings**, then a booking number. Or type the number in the search box.

1. Tabs: Overview, Money, Changes, History, and Drivers and documents.
2. Overview shows the trip, the renter, what is still missing for the handover, and the price.
3. Open tasks for this booking, with the queue and the due time.
4. Top right: **Stop blocking the calendar**, **Cancel for the renter** and **Cancel by CarmaCars**.
5. Under the booking number: where the booking is on its way, from Request to Closed, with the dates, the days, the total and who pays.

![](/guides/img/admin-04-booking-desktop-b56b668a.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 960; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10065; pins: 2 50.0 46.6, 4 85.4 14.5, 5 22.9 26.8")

## Check a car out or in

From the booking, with your phone or a tablet: the same checklist field staff use.

1. A confirmed booking shows **Check out (pickup)** under Check-out, check-in and signing; a booking on rent shows **Check in (return)**. Today lists the check-outs and check-ins due, each with **Check out** or **Check in**.
2. The checklist opens: the ready check, the renter and their licence and card, the odometer (km) and fuel or charge, the keys, the photo set (every side, the wheels, the interior, the odometer and fuel gauge, the plate), damage marks with close-ups, then the renter and you sign.
3. Photos wait on the device without a connection and upload in the background. Each keeps its time, and the place when the device allows location.
4. A field job of the booking is taken over (the history says so); with no job, one is made for you. When done, press **See the photo report**.

> Tip: Fleet, Sales and Customer service check cars out and in the same way from their own booking page.

## The photo report, late returns and the return charges

Under Check-out, check-in and signing, press **Photo report**.

1. The report shows the due-back time, the actual check-out and check-in, Late by (or Overdue by while the car is out), the odometer and kilometres over the allowance, the fuel or charge out and in, every photo with its time and place, and the damage.
2. At check-in the late return (after the grace period of the fee defaults), the mileage overage and the fuel or recharging are written to the return charges at once. A gas car with no pump receipt is priced at the refill price per eighth (Program settings) plus the markup until the receipt is entered.
3. Not charging one? Press **Waive** beside it and give the reason: it stays waived if the charges are worked out again.
4. The time was wrong? Press **Correct the check-in time** (or the check-out time) with the reason: lateness and the late charges follow, and the history keeps both times.
5. The renter gets the same report (without these buttons) by email and in their Documents. Late by shows on the booking and in the Bookings list.

## Signatures on the spot, or by link

The renter or an additional driver signs the rental agreement on your device, or on their own phone.

1. While a signature is missing, the booking shows **Sign now on this device**, **Email the signing link** and **Text the signing link**.
2. No agreement made yet (the renter has not saved their details at home)? **Sign now on this device** still shows: press **Prepare the agreement to sign now** and it is made on the spot.
3. **Sign now on this device**: confirm the name matches their licence and that you saw the original licence (photograph it if none is on file), then press **Hand the device to** and their name.
4. They read both agreements (CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s), tick the statements and sign. Then **Back to the staff view** for the next signer.
5. The record is the same as signing online, and says it was signed in person, collected by you, on your device. It is printed on the signed copy''s signature record page.

## Rental agreements: every version, every field

The booking''s Rental agreements card: the current version of CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s agreements, every earlier one, and what is still blank.

1. Once the agreement is signed and countersigned, any change to what it prints makes a new version of both documents by itself: the dates, the price lines, the car, a driver added or corrected, the coverage, the deposit or how it was paid, an address.
2. A change to the dates, the price, the car, the drivers or the coverage option is signed again: the renter (and each driver it affects) gets their link by email and text, and the card shows "Agreement v3 waiting for signature". A correction (a typo in an address, a plate written differently) is filed without signing; the renter gets the corrected copy by email.
3. Check-out makes the "as picked up" copy (time out, km out, fuel out, the car''s plate and VIN, the check-out report), countersigned by whoever checked the car out; check-in makes the closing copy (time in, km in, driven and charged, fuel in, late hours, damage, the return charges, the final totals). Both go to the renter by email.
4. **Every version** lists each one with what changed and both PDFs. **Resend the signing links**, or press the button with their first name beside it to have them sign on your phone or tablet.
5. The card lists what the agreements still print blank (a licence expiry, the insurer''s policy number, the insured vehicle, a VIN). Type the values and press **Save the missing fields**: the agreements follow.
6. Check-out stops while a field a claim needs is blank. An Admin can let it go ahead: type the reason and press **Override**; the reason is in the booking''s history.
7. **Make the agreements again** checks both against the booking at once (they also follow every change by themselves).

## Signing that holds up in a dispute

Every signature on the site is made the same way: rental agreements, amendments and new versions (remotely or on your device), and the owner agreements, schedules and forms, a co-owner''s link, the partner, investment and staff agreements.

1. The licence on file is shown. A 6-digit code to their phone or email on file is optional: the signer may press **Verify by code (optional)**, and Program settings, E-signing, **ask for a one-time code** makes it a required first step again (off by default). Without the code, the certificate says the identity was not confirmed by a code.
2. They say they read the documents, initial the key terms (each initials box is saved with **Save initials**; **Clear** takes it back to initial again) (damage and the deductible, the deposit and later charges, fuel, kilometres and late returns, their coverage, cancellation), give three consents (to sign electronically, to receive records electronically, to card charges under the agreement) and draw their signature.
3. Owners, partners, investors and staff do the same for their documents: the code, the reading, the key terms of their documents initialled (for example the Enrollment Agreement''s three confirmations, Form C''s acknowledgments, Schedule C, the staff agreement''s confidentiality), two consents and the drawn signature. Form C''s witness still types their name beside the owner.
4. Each step is recorded with its time, IP address and device, and the place when the device shares it. The signed PDFs end with a certificate of completion; anyone can check a signed file at `carmacars.ca/verify`.
5. Typed names are off. For a signer who cannot draw, an Admin can turn on the accessibility fallback: **Settings** > **Program**, Esign typed fallback.

## Card disputes: the evidence pack

Everything that proves the rental, in one PDF for Stripe.

1. When a card payment is disputed, the evidence pack is built by itself: the signed agreements with their certificates, the check-out and check-in reports with photos, kilometres and fuel, the licence, the payments and charges, every message to the renter, and the card checks from Stripe. It is staged in Stripe as the dispute''s evidence, and To do gets an urgent task.
2. Open the booking: the Rental agreements card shows the pack. Press **Download** to check it, then **Submit to Stripe** before the evidence date.
3. **Build the dispute evidence pack** makes one at any time (an Admin or Finance).

## The licence before an offer is accepted

Front, back and a selfie, from the request on.

1. After sending a request the renter is asked for their licence. A licence already on file from an earlier booking is used again while it is valid after the return.
2. The offer cannot be accepted (by the renter, or by you on their word) and nothing is paid until the licence and its expiry date are on file.
3. Review the images as usual with **Review documents**: the card Renter documents is on Review and offer too.
4. The switch is in **Settings** > **Program**, Booking requests and offers: Booking licence required (on), with the selfie (on).

## Renter documents: licence and proof of coverage

A renter''s licence photos, selfie and proof of coverage (OPCF 27 or a credit card''s rental coverage) are checked before the handover. You check them yourself; no task is needed.

1. A booking with documents waiting is a line on To do: "Check ''s documents for booking ", marked Now when the pickup is within two days. Press **Review documents**.
2. The pop-up shows each driver''s images and the coverage: the insurer, policy number and expiry, or the card, its type and whether the name matches.
3. What to check is written once at the top. One wrong? Open **Reject this one** under it, type the reason the renter reads and press **Reject**: they are asked for a new one.
4. Then press **Approve all**: every image, the proof of coverage and the Protection Plan still waiting are approved in one step. Anything the system refuses is named with the reason.
5. The same pop-up is on the booking: the card Renter documents (**Review documents**) on Overview and on Drivers and documents.

> Tip: Each opening of a renter''s documents is logged. The links to the images last one minute. Field staff can also check a licence in person at the check-out (photos and four checks): the history says "checked in person". Field staff also review the licence images (not the coverage) of bookings on their own jobs in the next 7 days from My jobs, with the same Approve all or a reason to reject: the history says the reviewer''s role, field. Sales review the licence images (not the coverage) of any booking being arranged or under way from their To do or the booking, with the same Approve all or a reason to reject: the history says the role, sales.

## Payments by day

**Money** > **Payments by day**: every payment and refund of a day or a range, by method, the cash drawer and the refunds waiting. Finance has the same screen.

1. Choose From and To and the methods (card, e-Transfer, cash, cheque, platform payout, insurer, bank transfer, pre-authorized debit, other), then press **Show**.
2. Totals by method and for each day; cards read as the card and its last four digits, never a code.
3. The cash drawer: expected (cash in less cash given back) against the count Finance records with **Record the count**; a difference shows over or short.
4. Refunds waiting: every refund asked for anywhere with the policy maths. **Approve** or **Decline** with the reason in the row, then **Issue the refund**.
5. **Export CSV** for the bookkeeper.

## Propose a change to a confirmed booking

The renter gets an email and answers on their booking. The calendar moves only when they accept.

1. Open the booking''s Changes tab. Under Propose a change, set the new pickup, return or car.
2. To price it by hand, type a New rental charge before tax. Leave it empty to use the car''s rates.
3. Write the Reason, for the renter. They read it.
4. Press **Preview the price**, then **Send to the renter**.

![](/guides/img/admin-05-booking-changes-desktop-97008b21.jpg "desktop; size: 1200 520; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10065?tab=changes; pins: 1 17.5 33.7, 2 9.2 50.0, 3 38.3 71.2, 4 12.9 91.9")

## Who a booking is credited to

Overview (and Review and offer) shows the Sales credit: the staff member the booking counts for in their sales.

1. A quote or a rental is credited to whoever created or added it. A request from the website is credited to whoever sent its first offer.
2. To give it to someone else, press **Reassign**, choose who (or Nobody), say whether they sourced the client and write the reason. The booking''s history and the audit log keep it, and the deal stays in the same week and month.
3. Sourced means the staff member chose I sourced this client when they entered it, it came with a field staff referral link, or you credited it. Only a sourced booking earns a staff commission. A website request earns none unless you credit someone.
4. Someone said they sourced a website request? The credit line shows the claim: press **Credit them** or **Not theirs**, with a reason.
5. A price typed by hand shows beside the rate-sheet price, with the reason. A price under the floor or past the discount limit is flagged: press **Mark reviewed** once you have looked at it.

> Tip: The renter has 48 hours to accept (and sign the amendment) or decline, with one reminder. Any extra is charged to their Card on File; a lower price raises a refund for your approval.

## Review requests

Every renter is asked for a review by email and text, as they chose, only from 9 am to 9 pm Toronto time. Nothing needs setting up.

| Message | When |
| --- | --- |
| Mid-trip check-in | Rentals of 2 days or more, 24 hours after the pickup: "How is the car? Reply or call if anything is off." No review ask. |
| Review request | 1 hour after the check-in. It links the review page: the renter taps what they liked, adds a sentence, and gets a short draft to copy and post on Google. |
| Reminder | 24 hours after the request. |
| Final follow-up | 7 days after the request. Nothing more after it. |

1. The booking page has the card Review requests: each message with when it went or when it will go, and why it stopped.
2. **Ask for a review** sends the request now (or at 9 am if it is later than 9 pm), on any booking on a trip, returned or closed. Not twice in 24 hours.
3. On hold: a return or later charge (late return, kilometres, fuel, cleaning, smoking, damage, tolls and tickets) is not settled or waived, or an incident or dispute is open. The request goes by itself once they are. Press **Send anyway** to send it now.
4. **Mark reviewed** stops the messages when the renter tells you they already reviewed.

The messages also stop by themselves when the renter presses "I already left a review", leaves a review on the site, unsubscribes, or a Google review is matched to them. **Bookings** > **Reviews** has the numbers (requests sent, on hold, reviews detected, the average rating), the hold list and the Google reviews to match.

> Tip: The draft is made only from what the renter picked and wrote, and from the booking (the car, how long, delivery or pickup). Everyone gets the Google link, whatever their stars; a renter who gives 3 stars or fewer also sees "Something wasn''t right? Tell us directly".

## What the owner sees, and owner deductions

Each booking on an owner''s or partner''s car shows the card What the owner sees at the top of its page.

1. **Hide from the owner** keeps the booking''s revenue from the owner until the car is returned, or until the owner statement covering it is approved. The owner sees the booking as Booked with its dates, and the calendar still shows the car busy. Add a reason if you like: it is kept in the history.
2. **Show to the owner** shows it now. Approving the statement shows every hidden booking on it by itself.
3. Not shown to the owner is for a booking with no owner revenue (an insurance placeholder, a shareholder''s or the owner''s own use at no charge): the owner sees only that the car is unavailable for those dates. A booking with revenue cannot be set this way.
4. Add a rental and Send an offer have What the owner sees. It starts from Settings > Program, Owners and fleet: Owners see a booking''s revenue (right away by default).
5. On the Money tab, Owner deductions on this booking: **Add a booking expense** (cleaning, repair, fuel, platform fee or other, the amount, the reason the owner reads, a receipt number) comes off before Owner Revenue.
6. **Set the Revenue Share for this booking** applies within the car''s signed terms. Above the terms only an Admin can, with Above the signed terms ticked and the reason. **Back to the car''s terms** undoes it.
7. Add a rental has the same under The car''s owner.

> Good to know: The owner''s statement always includes every booking at its true amounts and lists each deduction with its reason, so the payout is always right. Customer service and sales add deductions only while Program settings let them change fees.

## Email the renter or the adjuster

Press **Email the renter** at the top of a booking, or open its **Messages** tab.

1. Write a **Subject** and a **Message**, or pick a **Quick reply** to start from (Settings > Quick replies keeps them).
2. Press **Email the renter**. It goes from CarmaCars (bookings@carmacars.ca) and replies come back to the bookings inbox. The renter also sees it in their account and can answer there.
3. On a booking an insurer pays, choose **From**: CarmaCars, or Blind Spot Car Rental (insurance). **Email the adjuster** writes to the adjuster''s email on the booking (Insurance claim), always from Blind Spot Car Rental.

The Messages tab shows what you and the renter wrote, newest first, with who wrote it, and every email of the booking with its state (waiting, sent, failed). Each email you send is also in the History tab with your name.

> Good to know: Emails go out through the same daily limit as every email (the line under the form shows today''s use). A message to a renter goes before digests and marketing; past the limit it waits until midnight. To write to a renter from **People** > **Renters**, open the renter: Email the renter is at the bottom, about their latest booking or the one you pick.

### Record the pickup or the return now (details later)
When the car went out or came back but the checklist could not be done (no photos, no time, the renter dropped the keys), the booking''s **Check-out, check-in and signing** card has **Record the pickup now (details later)** on a confirmed booking and **Record the return now (details later)** while the car is on rent. Give the actual time (now, or earlier), the odometer and fuel if you know them, and why. The booking moves on (on rent, or returned), late return charges follow the actual time, and Fleet gets the task **Add the photos and readings for CC-...**. Once returned, the statement can be issued and the deposit settled; releasing the deposit before the photos are in needs an Admin and a reason. A pickup without the deposit taken needs an Admin to waive it with a reason, and without the renter''s signature on the check-out report an Admin''s reason too. Later, **Add the check-out (or check-in) photos and readings** opens the usual checklist (photos, readings, your signature): the task closes when it is saved.

The Agreement card says **Waiting for the renter''s details** when the renter still has blanks to fill (date of birth, address, mobile, licence, coverage): their account asks for them before signing and paying. No email or text is sent.', 'Requests, offers and bookings', 'Send an offer with or without a request, change it in place, take payments by part, run a booking, propose a change.',
  'A booking starts as a request from the website, or as an offer you send yourself to a customer on the phone. You check it, adjust it and send the offer; an offer that is out is changed in place. After that, the booking page holds the money, documents, changes and history.

## The request queue

Open **Bookings** > **Requests**. The oldest waiting request is at the top.

1. Filter by New, Waiting on the renter, Pushed back, Offer out, Signing and payment, or Offer expired.
2. Waiting shows how long the renter has waited; red means past the first reply target (5 minutes, set in Program settings). Open a booking number to answer it.

![](/guides/img/admin-02-requests-desktop-6521282d.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 820; address: carmacars.ca/admin/requests; pins: 1 38.9 29.9, 2 22.2 43.3")

> Good to know: A request whose pickup time passes without an offer expires by itself, with a note in its history. The renter is not emailed unless "Email the renter when their request expires that way" is on in Program settings.

## Answer a request with an offer

1. The Review and offer tab shows the request as the renter sent it.
2. Adjust the car, the dates, the rate type, the places, the rates and fees, the deposit and extras.
3. Price on the right updates as you change things.
4. Add a message, choose how long the offer stays open, then press **Send the offer**.

![](/guides/img/admin-03-booking-review-desktop-353f3707.jpg "desktop; size: 1200 1550; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10069?tab=review; pins: 1 5.0 6.5, 2 7.5 45.8, 3 74.2 42.6, 4 76.7 98.1")

5. Changed fields but not ready to send? Press **Save changes**. The panel "The offer as the renter sees it" shows the result.
6. Can''t do it? Press **Decline** and fill in Reason and any alternative.
7. Need an answer first? Press **Ask the renter** to send a question.

![](/guides/img/admin-03-booking-review-desktop-4dd4ed06.jpg "desktop; size: 500 80; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10069?tab=review; pins: 6 41.2 52.5, 7 18.0 52.5")

Opening a request takes it for you: everyone else sees "Being answered by" your name and since when, with Send the offer and Decline off, until you send, decline or leave (20 minutes, renewed while you work; Program settings). Press **Take over** to answer one someone else holds; it is noted in the history. A second answer is refused with who answered and when. A request from the website opens to Sales after 15 minutes (Program settings); until then Admins, customer service and fleet answer it.

## Send an offer without a request

**Bookings** > **Send an offer**, or **Send an offer** on Bookings and on Requests. For a customer on the phone, by text or at the counter: no request needed.

1. The customer: type a name, phone or email and choose them. Not on file? Press **Add a new customer**: full legal name, mobile, email (the offer link goes there) and date of birth. A customer already on file with the same email or phone is shown with Use: one person, one record.
2. The car and the dates: type the car code, plate or name, or choose from the list; each car says Free or Not free for the dates. Then the pickup and return places (our location, delivery with the address and distance, airport).
3. The price: the Rate sheet, A total for the whole rental, or A rate per day (times the days). A price typed by hand needs its reason. At the top of the price, Amounts I type: Before tax, or After tax (HST included) to type what the renter pays for each line, worked back to the amount before tax for you (a line without HST stays as typed; the choice is remembered on this device). Or type the Total the renter pays (after tax): the rental charge is worked out so the total comes to it exactly, the other lines kept. Set the kilometres, a promo code, the deposit, a discount and each fee (an Admin), and how damage is covered: with option 3 the Protection Plan price is the one the renter pays.
4. How it is paid: the rental by card online (the usual way), e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout or the insurer; the deposit by card hold, cash, e-Transfer or no deposit (an Admin).
5. Who found this client, the message to the renter, how long the offer is open, and how the link goes: Email, Text, both or neither.
6. The right side is the offer as the renter will see it, priced by the database as you type. Press **Send the offer**. **Save without sending** keeps it as a request for later.

> Good to know: It makes the same request and offer the website makes: the renter approves, signs and pays (or you record the payment), and only then is the car on the calendar. No "request received" email goes to the renter for an offer you send. Staff commissions and statements count it like any other booking.

## Change an offer that is out

The renter has the offer (Offered), or approved it and has not paid (Signing and payment). Open **More actions** on the booking and press **Edit the offer**.

1. Change anything: the car, the dates, the places, the price, fees, the deposit, add-ons, how it is paid. Each changed field is highlighted and the before and after are listed. Amounts I type (Before tax or After tax) and the Total the renter pays (after tax) work as on Send an offer.
2. Write what changed in Message to the renter and choose how long the offer is open.
3. Press **Save and send the update**: the renter gets the new version by email or text (ticked), and the old version no longer counts. Or press **Save without telling the renter** and tell them yourself.
4. A confirmed booking is changed with **Change the booking** (Propose a change, below).

> Tip: No need to withdraw first. **Withdraw the offer** is only for taking it back for good; **Send again, later expiry** gives the renter more time, and **Renter approved by phone** records a yes given on a call.

## Edit a booking that has started

On a confirmed, on-trip or returned booking (an Admin: a closed one too), Overview, **Edit the booking**, **Edit**.

1. Change the pickup or the return (extend or shorten: the rental charge is worked out again at this booking''s rates), the car (on trip: the car it leaves goes to Out of service for Fleet to check), the rental charge for the trip, each fee, the kilometres a day, the deposit (an Admin) and the note.
2. Type why, if you like, and tick **Email the renter what changed**, or leave it off for a silent correction. Press **Save the changes**.
3. What is open now shows at once: **Email a pay link** or **Text a pay link** for exactly that amount, **Charge** the saved card (the renter agreed), or record cash or an e-Transfer on the Money tab.

> Good to know: Each edit is kept with who, when, why, before and after (Edits, under the form) and in the booking''s history. A closed booking''s owner split and the staff commission follow. To have the renter accept and sign first, use Propose a change instead.

## Fees, a forgotten fee and the balance

On the booking''s Money tab, Fees lists each fee. Press **Change or add a fee**.

1. Type a new amount (for the whole trip, before HST) beside any fee, or choose one not on the booking (the young driver fee shows its price for these dates), or add a charge of its own with or without HST.
2. Press **Save the fees**. The balance shows by part (rental, fees) with the pay link, the saved card and Record a payment beside it.
3. The renter sees the balance on their booking with a Pay button, and pays by card on Stripe''s form.

> Good to know: Every change is recorded (Changes to the fees): the amount before and after, who and why. Customer service and sales may change fees while Program settings, Staff may change fees, is on.

## Correct a renter''s details

On the renter''s page (People, Renters) or on any of their bookings, **Edit renter**.

1. Correct the name, email, phone, date of birth, licence, home address (start typing to find it) or the staff note.
2. A new email also becomes their sign-in at once (no confirmation needed for a typo you correct); tick **Email the renter a link to set a password** to send one there. Unsigned agreements and offers go to the new address.
3. Press **Save the renter**. An email that another renter has is refused with their name; the same phone is a warning.
4. The same person entered twice? Possible duplicates (same email, same phone, or same name and date of birth) shows under the renter. **Merge into this record** moves the other record''s bookings, licences, cards, payments, documents and messages here and fills any detail missing here; the other record stays, blocked, with the merge in both histories.

## Payments by part: the rental, the deposit and later charges

On the booking''s Money tab, Money by part shows what is still open for the rental, the fees and later charges, the deposit and the card on file. Each part is paid its own way, in any mix: for example the deposit in cash and the rental by card.

1. **Record a payment**: choose what it is for (the rental, fees, the deposit or a later charge) and how it was paid (e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer, platform payout, the insurer). An e-Transfer, cheque or transfer needs its reference. Press **Record it**. The renter gets a receipt; **Print** prints one to hand over.
2. **Collect a card**: a payment (Everything open by default: the rental, the fees and any later charge in one), the deposit hold or saving the card. The renter types the card in Stripe''s secure form: on this device (**Open the card form**, then hand it over) or by a link texted or emailed to them (**Send the link**). Staff never type a card number.
3. A deposit hold lasts about 7 days and shows the days left; while the car is out it is collected by itself before it lapses. After the return, settle the deposit (below). **Capture the hold** for all of it keeps the money; a part capture or **Release the hold** waits for the settlement while the car is out or something is open (an Admin may do it with the reason).
4. **Charge the saved card** (Finance or an Admin): extra kilometres, fuel, damage or a late return, with the reason the renter''s receipt shows. For a rental over 7 days, save the card and charge the deposit this way.
5. An offer paid another way: once the renter approved and signed and the money is recorded, the booking is confirmed (or press **Confirm the booking**).
6. A deposit taken in cash or by e-Transfer is given back the same way after the return: Finance gets a task; press **Returned** with the reference or receipt number.

> Good to know: Statements, reconciliation and the deposit settlement read each payment with its method: a cash deposit is never refunded to a card.

## Settle the deposit

The deposit is never given back by itself. Finance or an Admin settles it after the return: on the booking''s Money tab, under Deposit, press **Settle the deposit**. Issue the Check-in statement first.

1. The form shows the deposit, what is still available, the charges owed from the statement and what is taken from the deposit for them. What the deposit does not cover is charged to the card on file; with no card (or a card declined), the renter gets a pay link by email and text, and Finance has a task until it is paid.
2. Tolls and tickets can take up to 7 days to come in. Inside that window the whole rest of the deposit is filled in as the hold-back, until the window ends. To give it back sooner, tick Release now anyway: a toll that comes in later is charged to the card on file.
3. Something still open keeps the whole deposit: an incident, a claim, new damage at the return not priced, damage found later not billed, a toll or ticket on the car during the rental not matched or not charged, a card dispute, or charges not on a statement yet. The form lists them. Only an Admin can release part of it, with the reason; it is recorded.
4. Damage: **Keep the whole deposit (damage)** turns what is left of the deposit into a damage charge, with what was damaged and the photos; the renter is told. **Bill damage** adds a damage charge up to the $2,500 deductible (more goes through a claim): the deposit pays first, then the card on file.
5. Press **Settle**. The money moves at Stripe at once: the charges are collected and what is not owed is refunded or the hold released. A step Stripe refuses is tried again by itself, and Finance gets a task if it keeps failing.

> Good to know: A card hold lapses after about 7 days. While the car is out, or returned and not settled, the hold is collected in full a day and a half before it lapses: that keeps the money, and the settlement refunds what is not owed. A hold that lapses anyway is charged to the saved card, and Finance is told at once.

## A booking

Open **Bookings** > **Bookings**, then a booking number. Or type the number in the search box.

1. Tabs: Overview, Money, Changes, History, and Drivers and documents.
2. Overview shows the trip, the renter, what is still missing for the handover, and the price.
3. Open tasks for this booking, with the queue and the due time.
4. Top right: **Email the renter** and **More actions**, the menu with **Edit the offer**, **Stop blocking the calendar**, **Cancel for the renter**, **Cancel by CarmaCars** and the rest.
5. Under the booking number: **Next step**, what happens next and who does it, with one button for that step (for example **Send the offer**, **Sign on this device** or **Check out the car**); then where the booking is on its way, from Request to Closed, with the dates, the days, the total and who pays.

![](/guides/img/admin-04-booking-desktop-b56b668a.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 960; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10065; pins: 2 50.0 46.6, 4 85.4 14.5, 5 22.9 26.8")

## Check a car out or in

From the booking, with your phone or a tablet: the same checklist field staff use.

1. A confirmed booking shows **Check out (pickup)** under Check-out, check-in and signing; a booking on rent shows **Check in (return)**. Today lists the check-outs and check-ins due, each with **Check out** or **Check in**.
2. The checklist opens: the ready check, the renter and their licence and card, the odometer (km) and fuel or charge, the keys, the photo set (every side, the wheels, the interior, the odometer and fuel gauge, the plate), damage marks with close-ups, then the renter and you sign.
3. Photos wait on the device without a connection and upload in the background. Each keeps its time, and the place when the device allows location.
4. A field job of the booking is taken over (the history says so); with no job, one is made for you. When done, press **See the photo report**.

> Tip: Fleet, Sales and Customer service check cars out and in the same way from their own booking page.

## The photo report, late returns and the return charges

Under Check-out, check-in and signing, press **Photo report**.

1. The report shows the due-back time, the actual check-out and check-in, Late by (or Overdue by while the car is out), the odometer and kilometres over the allowance, the fuel or charge out and in, every photo with its time and place, and the damage.
2. At check-in the late return (after the grace period of the fee defaults), the mileage overage and the fuel or recharging are written to the return charges at once. A gas car with no pump receipt is priced at the refill price per eighth (Program settings) plus the markup until the receipt is entered.
3. Not charging one? Press **Waive** beside it and give the reason: it stays waived if the charges are worked out again.
4. The time was wrong? Press **Correct the check-in time** (or the check-out time) with the reason: lateness and the late charges follow, and the history keeps both times.
5. The renter gets the same report (without these buttons) by email and in their Documents. Late by shows on the booking and in the Bookings list.

## Signatures on the spot, or by link

The renter or an additional driver signs the rental agreement on your device, or on their own phone.

1. While a signature is missing, the booking shows **Sign now on this device**, **Email the signing link** and **Text the signing link**.
2. No agreement made yet (the renter has not saved their details at home)? **Sign now on this device** still shows: press **Prepare the agreement to sign now** and it is made on the spot.
3. **Sign now on this device**: confirm the name matches their licence and that you saw the original licence (photograph it if none is on file), then press **Hand the device to** and their name.
4. They read both agreements (CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s), tick the statements and sign. Then **Back to the staff view** for the next signer.
5. The record is the same as signing online, and says it was signed in person, collected by you, on your device. It is printed on the signed copy''s signature record page.

## Rental agreements: every version, every field

The booking''s Rental agreements card: the current version of CarmaCars'' and Blind Spot''s agreements, every earlier one, and what is still blank.

1. Once the agreement is signed and countersigned, any change to what it prints makes a new version of both documents by itself: the dates, the price lines, the car, a driver added or corrected, the coverage, the deposit or how it was paid, an address.
2. A change to the dates, the price, the car, the drivers or the coverage option is signed again: the renter (and each driver it affects) gets their link by email and text, and the card shows "Agreement v3 waiting for signature". A correction (a typo in an address, a plate written differently) is filed without signing; the renter gets the corrected copy by email.
3. Check-out makes the "as picked up" copy (time out, km out, fuel out, the car''s plate and VIN, the check-out report), countersigned by whoever checked the car out; check-in makes the closing copy (time in, km in, driven and charged, fuel in, late hours, damage, the return charges, the final totals). Both go to the renter by email.
4. **Every version** lists each one with what changed and both PDFs. **Resend the signing links**, or press the button with their first name beside it to have them sign on your phone or tablet.
5. The card lists what the agreements still print blank (a licence expiry, the insurer''s policy number, the insured vehicle, a VIN). Type the values and press **Save the missing fields**: the agreements follow.
6. Check-out stops while a field a claim needs is blank. An Admin can let it go ahead: type the reason and press **Override**; the reason is in the booking''s history.
7. **Make the agreements again** checks both against the booking at once (they also follow every change by themselves).
8. **Edit the wording** (Admin only) changes CarmaCars'' agreement text for this booking: press **Change** beside a clause, edit its text, say why and press **Save the wording**; **Add** writes Additional terms at the end of Part 2. Only clauses not required by law or the insurer can be removed; the consents are fixed, and Blind Spot''s form (the insurer''s official form) is never changed. Before the renter signs, the agreement is made again; after, the change is a new version they sign, and **Every version** shows each clause before and after.

## Signing that holds up in a dispute

Every signature on the site is made the same way: rental agreements, amendments and new versions (remotely or on your device), and the owner agreements, schedules and forms, a co-owner''s link, the partner, investment and staff agreements.

1. The licence on file is shown. A 6-digit code to their phone or email on file is optional: the signer may press **Verify by code (optional)**, and Program settings, E-signing, **ask for a one-time code** makes it a required first step again (off by default). Without the code, the certificate says the identity was not confirmed by a code.
2. They say they read the documents, initial the key terms (each initials box is saved with **Save initials**; **Clear** takes it back to initial again) (damage and the deductible, the deposit and later charges, fuel, kilometres and late returns, their coverage, cancellation), give three consents (to sign electronically, to receive records electronically, to card charges under the agreement) and draw their signature.
3. Owners, partners, investors and staff do the same for their documents: the code, the reading, the key terms of their documents initialled (for example the Enrollment Agreement''s three confirmations, Form C''s acknowledgments, Schedule C, the staff agreement''s confidentiality), two consents and the drawn signature. Form C''s witness still types their name beside the owner.
4. Each step is recorded with its time, IP address and device, and the place when the device shares it. The signed PDFs end with a certificate of completion; anyone can check a signed file at `carmacars.ca/verify`.
5. Typed names are off. For a signer who cannot draw, an Admin can turn on the accessibility fallback: **Settings** > **Program**, Esign typed fallback.

## Card disputes: the evidence pack

Everything that proves the rental, in one PDF for Stripe.

1. When a card payment is disputed, the evidence pack is built by itself: the signed agreements with their certificates, the check-out and check-in reports with photos, kilometres and fuel, the licence, the payments and charges, every message to the renter, and the card checks from Stripe. It is staged in Stripe as the dispute''s evidence, and To do gets an urgent task.
2. Open the booking: the Rental agreements card shows the pack. Press **Download** to check it, then **Submit to Stripe** before the evidence date.
3. **Build the dispute evidence pack** makes one at any time (an Admin or Finance).

## The licence before an offer is accepted

Front, back and a selfie, from the request on.

1. After sending a request the renter is asked for their licence. A licence already on file from an earlier booking is used again while it is valid after the return.
2. The offer cannot be accepted (by the renter, or by you on their word) and nothing is paid until the licence and its expiry date are on file.
3. Review the images as usual with **Review documents**: the card Renter documents is on Review and offer too.
4. The switch is in **Settings** > **Program**, Booking requests and offers: Booking licence required (on), with the selfie (on).

## Renter documents: licence and proof of coverage

A renter''s licence photos, selfie and proof of coverage (OPCF 27 or a credit card''s rental coverage) are checked before the handover. You check them yourself; no task is needed.

1. A booking with documents waiting is a line on To do: "Check ''s documents for booking ", marked Now when the pickup is within two days. Press **Review documents**.
2. The pop-up shows each driver''s images and the coverage: the insurer, policy number and expiry, or the card, its type and whether the name matches.
3. What to check is written once at the top. One wrong? Open **Reject this one** under it, type the reason the renter reads and press **Reject**: they are asked for a new one.
4. Then press **Approve all**: every image, the proof of coverage and the Protection Plan still waiting are approved in one step. Anything the system refuses is named with the reason.
5. The same pop-up is on the booking: the card Renter documents (**Review documents**) on Overview and on Drivers and documents.

> Tip: Each opening of a renter''s documents is logged. The links to the images last one minute. Field staff can also check a licence in person at the check-out (photos and four checks): the history says "checked in person". Field staff also review the licence images (not the coverage) of bookings on their own jobs in the next 7 days from My jobs, with the same Approve all or a reason to reject: the history says the reviewer''s role, field. Sales review the licence images (not the coverage) of any booking being arranged or under way from their To do or the booking, with the same Approve all or a reason to reject: the history says the role, sales.

## Payments by day

**Money** > **Payments by day**: every payment and refund of a day or a range, by method, the cash drawer and the refunds waiting. Finance has the same screen.

1. Choose From and To and the methods (card, e-Transfer, cash, cheque, platform payout, insurer, bank transfer, pre-authorized debit, other), then press **Show**.
2. Totals by method and for each day; cards read as the card and its last four digits, never a code.
3. The cash drawer: expected (cash in less cash given back) against the count Finance records with **Record the count**; a difference shows over or short.
4. Refunds waiting: every refund asked for anywhere with the policy maths. **Approve** or **Decline** with the reason in the row, then **Issue the refund**.
5. **Export CSV** for the bookkeeper.

## Propose a change to a confirmed booking

The renter gets an email and answers on their booking. The calendar moves only when they accept.

1. Open the booking''s Changes tab. Under Propose a change, set the new pickup, return or car.
2. To price it by hand, type a New rental charge before tax. Leave it empty to use the car''s rates.
3. Write the Reason, for the renter. They read it.
4. Press **Preview the price**, then **Send to the renter**.

![](/guides/img/admin-05-booking-changes-desktop-97008b21.jpg "desktop; size: 1200 520; address: carmacars.ca/admin/bookings/CC-10065?tab=changes; pins: 1 17.5 33.7, 2 9.2 50.0, 3 38.3 71.2, 4 12.9 91.9")

## Who a booking is credited to

Overview (and Review and offer) shows the Sales credit: the staff member the booking counts for in their sales.

1. A quote or a rental is credited to whoever created or added it. A request from the website is credited to whoever sent its first offer.
2. To give it to someone else, press **Reassign**, choose who (or Nobody), say whether they sourced the client and write the reason. The booking''s history and the audit log keep it, and the deal stays in the same week and month.
3. Sourced means the staff member chose I sourced this client when they entered it, it came with a field staff referral link, or you credited it. Only a sourced booking earns a staff commission. A website request earns none unless you credit someone.
4. Someone said they sourced a website request? The credit line shows the claim: press **Credit them** or **Not theirs**, with a reason.
5. A price typed by hand shows beside the rate-sheet price, with the reason. A price under the floor or past the discount limit is flagged: press **Mark reviewed** once you have looked at it.

> Tip: The renter has 48 hours to accept (and sign the amendment) or decline, with one reminder. Any extra is charged to their Card on File; a lower price raises a refund for your approval.

## Review requests

Every renter is asked for a review by email and text, as they chose, only from 9 am to 9 pm Toronto time. Nothing needs setting up.

| Message | When |
| --- | --- |
| Mid-trip check-in | Rentals of 2 days or more, 24 hours after the pickup: "How is the car? Reply or call if anything is off." No review ask. |
| Review request | 1 hour after the check-in. It links the review page: the renter taps what they liked, adds a sentence, and gets a short draft to copy and post on Google. |
| Reminder | 24 hours after the request. |
| Final follow-up | 7 days after the request. Nothing more after it. |

1. The booking page has the card Review requests: each message with when it went or when it will go, and why it stopped.
2. **Ask for a review** sends the request now (or at 9 am if it is later than 9 pm), on any booking on a trip, returned or closed. Not twice in 24 hours.
3. On hold: a return or later charge (late return, kilometres, fuel, cleaning, smoking, damage, tolls and tickets) is not settled or waived, or an incident or dispute is open. The request goes by itself once they are. Press **Send anyway** to send it now.
4. **Mark reviewed** stops the messages when the renter tells you they already reviewed.

The messages also stop by themselves when the renter presses "I already left a review", leaves a review on the site, unsubscribes, or a Google review is matched to them. **Bookings** > **Reviews** has the numbers (requests sent, on hold, reviews detected, the average rating), the hold list and the Google reviews to match.

> Tip: The draft is made only from what the renter picked and wrote, and from the booking (the car, how long, delivery or pickup). Everyone gets the Google link, whatever their stars; a renter who gives 3 stars or fewer also sees "Something wasn''t right? Tell us directly".

## What the owner sees, and owner deductions

Each booking on an owner''s or partner''s car shows the card What the owner sees at the top of its page.

1. **Hide from the owner** keeps the booking''s revenue from the owner until the car is returned, or until the owner statement covering it is approved. The owner sees the booking as Booked with its dates, and the calendar still shows the car busy. Add a reason if you like: it is kept in the history.
2. **Show to the owner** shows it now. Approving the statement shows every hidden booking on it by itself.
3. Not shown to the owner is for a booking with no owner revenue (an insurance placeholder, a shareholder''s or the owner''s own use at no charge): the owner sees only that the car is unavailable for those dates. A booking with revenue cannot be set this way.
4. Add a rental and Send an offer have What the owner sees. It starts from Settings > Program, Owners and fleet: Owners see a booking''s revenue (right away by default).
5. On the Money tab, Owner deductions on this booking: **Add a booking expense** (cleaning, repair, fuel, platform fee or other, the amount, the reason the owner reads, a receipt number) comes off before Owner Revenue.
6. **Set the Revenue Share for this booking** applies within the car''s signed terms. Above the terms only an Admin can, with Above the signed terms ticked and the reason. **Back to the car''s terms** undoes it.
7. Add a rental has the same under The car''s owner.

> Good to know: The owner''s statement always includes every booking at its true amounts and lists each deduction with its reason, so the payout is always right. Customer service and sales add deductions only while Program settings let them change fees.

## Email the renter or the adjuster

Press **Email the renter** at the top of a booking, or open its **Messages** tab.

1. Write a **Subject** and a **Message**, or pick a **Quick reply** to start from (Settings > Quick replies keeps them).
2. Press **Email the renter**. It goes from CarmaCars (bookings@carmacars.ca) and replies come back to the bookings inbox. The renter also sees it in their account and can answer there.
3. On a booking an insurer pays, choose **From**: CarmaCars, or Blind Spot Car Rental (insurance). **Email the adjuster** writes to the adjuster''s email on the booking (Insurance claim), always from Blind Spot Car Rental.

The Messages tab shows what you and the renter wrote, newest first, with who wrote it, and every email of the booking with its state (waiting, sent, failed). Each email you send is also in the History tab with your name.

> Good to know: Emails go out through the same daily limit as every email (the line under the form shows today''s use). A message to a renter goes before digests and marketing; past the limit it waits until midnight. To write to a renter from **People** > **Renters**, open the renter: Email the renter is at the bottom, about their latest booking or the one you pick.

### Record the pickup or the return now (details later)
When the car went out or came back but the checklist could not be done (no photos, no time, the renter dropped the keys), the booking''s **Check-out, check-in and signing** card has **Record the pickup now (details later)** on a confirmed booking and **Record the return now (details later)** while the car is on rent. Give the actual time (now, or earlier), the odometer and fuel if you know them, and why. The booking moves on (on rent, or returned), late return charges follow the actual time, and Fleet gets the task **Add the photos and readings for CC-...**. Once returned, the statement can be issued and the deposit settled; releasing the deposit before the photos are in needs an Admin and a reason. A pickup without the deposit taken needs an Admin to waive it with a reason, and without the renter''s signature on the check-out report an Admin''s reason too. Later, **Add the check-out (or check-in) photos and readings** opens the usual checklist (photos, readings, your signature): the task closes when it is saved.

The Agreement card says **Waiting for the renter''s details** when the renter still has blanks to fill (date of birth, address, mobile, licence, coverage): their account asks for them before signing and paying. No email or text is sent.',

select app.guide_release_section('admin', 'owners-and-onboarding', 'chapter', 'chauffeur-service', 'Owners apply on the site with List your car. Every application waits for you in one place, Applications: approve it, ask the owner for something, or decline it. Approved owners sign and pay in their portal.

## Applications

**People** > **Applications**. Every owner application, newest first.

1. The chips filter by status: New, Waiting on owner, Approved, Declined, or All. New applications also show on To do.
2. Each row shows the application number, the owner, the car, how many of the four checks are done, and when they applied.
3. Open an application to decide.

![](/guides/img/admin-33-applications-desktop-152f9e34.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 640; address: carmacars.ca/admin/applications; pins: 1 36.8 39.7, 2 48.6 53.1, 3 19.8 53.1")

## Decide on an application

One page holds everything: the owner, the car, the uploads, the four checks and the notes.

1. Check the driver''s licence, the ownership, the insurance and the lender or lessor. Mark each one Checked, fine, Problem or Not needed.
2. Press **Approve**. The step "Terms and first invoice" opens for each car, filled in with the owner''s negotiated terms (or the standard grid): Insurance Fee, Tracker Fee, management fee (Revenue Share), Install Fee and the first and last month amount (2 x the Insurance Fee unless you type an exact amount). Change any of them to the cent; with several cars, **Use these terms for every car** copies the first car''s numbers to the others.
3. Choose the invoices: First and last month, Registration fee (any exact amount), Tracker install (only once trackers are available) and Another invoice. For each one choose Send now, Save as draft or Already paid. Already paid asks how (e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer or other), the date and the reference: it is recorded like Record payment and the owner gets the receipt, not an invoice.
4. Press **Approve** at the bottom of the step. Nothing is set or sent before that. The owner becomes active, the documents open for one signature in their portal, only the invoices you chose are made, and the owner gets one email.
5. Missing something? Press **Ask for something**, tick what you need (for example the ownership permit or the insurance slip), add a message if you like, and press **Send to the owner**. The owner gets an email and a task in their portal; the application shows Waiting on owner until they answer.
6. Not a fit? Press **Decline**, write the Reason the owner reads, and press **Decline the application**. The owner is emailed for each car.

![](/guides/img/admin-34-application-desktop-98b64f92.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 812; address: carmacars.ca/admin/applications/c324ef8d-ad00-4bcc-bf04-ca68628a26b4; pins: 1 72.9 67.1, 2 73.9 42.9, 3 84.7 42.9, 4 72.9 49.6")

The application has an Invoices tab: every invoice of its cars, drafts and voids included. An application staff entered for the owner says "Entered by staff" and who; approving it sends the owner the set-up email (review the details and sign) instead of the approval email.

> Tip: Notes on the page are for staff only: **Add note** keeps a line on the record. When the owner answers a request, their answer is in the notes and the application is New again.

## Add a car for an owner

**People** > **Add a car for an owner**, or **Add another car** on an owner''s page. The owner never has to fill in the application.

1. The owner: find them by name, email or phone, or choose New owner and enter the name, email, phone and address.
2. The car: type the VIN. The car is looked up at once and shown in one line (Edit if something is wrong); no VIN at hand, add it by its plate with the year, make and model from the lists. Tap the colour, check the class, then the odometer, insurer and whether it is owned, financed or leased. Photos are optional: the listing shows sample photos until real ones are added. Upload the ownership permit, the insurance slip and the lender''s information if you have them.
3. Terms and first invoice: the same fields as Approve. For another car of the same owner they start from that owner''s terms, or their other car''s; change them for this car.
4. Who sourced the owner: Entered for CarmaCars, or I sourced this owner (only then are you recorded as the one who brought the owner). How the owner signs: by email, or on paper.
5. Press **Add the car and set it up**. The owner gets one email: review the details, correct anything, and sign. An owner with no sign-in gets the link to choose a password in that same email.

Customer service and fleet assistants add cars the same way from their portal; theirs wait in Applications for you, with the terms and invoices they proposed already filled in. On an approved application staff entered, **Send the set-up email again** sends the owner the email with a fresh link.

## Owners

**People** > **Owners**. Every owner, with their cars and where onboarding stands.

1. Each owner shows their application, how many cars, and where onboarding stands.
2. **View as (owner portal)** shows their portal. **Send password link** helps them sign in.
3. Invite an owner on file: fill in Name and Email under Invite an owner, then press **Send invitation**.

![](/guides/img/admin-12-owners-desktop-3a54d505.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 560; address: carmacars.ca/admin/owners; pins: 1 41.0 42.9, 2 37.4 49.3, 3 77.4 82.5")

The owner signs everything at once in their portal (Check and sign: the agreements, schedules and Forms A and B; the official registry forms are printed and signed in ink). The confirmations to tick, then one signature: CarmaCars countersigns at the same moment, under the signing officer''s standing authorization. A car with a second owner on the ownership waits for that owner too: they get their own link by email and sign the same documents.

## Mark a car insured (Insurer confirmed)

A program owner''s car is handed over to a renter only once the insurer confirms in writing that it is on the fleet policy. Requests, offers and payment never wait for it.

1. Each car waiting for the insurer is a line on To do: "Insurer has not confirmed : mark it insured". It says Now when a booking picks the car up soon.
2. When the insurer''s email arrives, press **Mark insured**. The date is today; change it to the date of the insurer''s email if it was earlier. Add its subject as the Reference if you like, and press **Insurer confirmed**.
3. One email for several cars? Press **Mark several insured** on the line " cars wait for the insurer". Every waiting car is ticked: untick any car the insurer did not name, check the date, and confirm them all at once.
4. The same button is on the car: Overview (**Insurer confirmed**) and the Listing tab''s checklist, item "Not on the fleet insurance policy yet".

The car is then on the fleet policy from that date: it can be handed over, its Enrollment Date is that date, its fee terms start, and the owner gets the email "Written confirmation: your car is on the fleet policy". Its paperwork (agreements, registry visit, tracker) stays on its checklist until done. A car already listed and Available stays Available.

## Owners who paid another way, and the terms you agreed

Two lines on To do keep an owner''s money right without opening their page.

1. "Record the first and last month paid by ": their first and last month invoice was voided and nothing paid is recorded. Press **Record what they paid**, type the amount for each car (tax included), or one total for several cars, how and when it was paid and the reference. A draft first and last month invoice is kept or voided, your choice. Each car''s invoice is then marked paid, the owner gets the receipt and the two prepaid months count. Never for a shareholder.
2. "Enter the terms agreed with ": their cars still use the standard grid. Press **Enter the terms**: the Management fee (Revenue Share), the Insurance Fee, the Tracker Fee, the Install Fee and the first and last month are filled in from the grid. Type what you agreed for the owner, and open a car to give it its own. A car whose schedule is signed gets an updated schedule for the owner to sign.
3. Nothing to change? Press **Not needed** or **These are correct**: the line does not come back.

## A shareholder''s own car

On the owner''s page, each car has **Shareholder’s own car**.

1. A shareholder''s own car is split 90/10 (the share in Program settings) and pays no Insurance Fee, Tracker Fee, first and last month or tracker install.
2. Press **Shareholder’s own car**, say why (it is kept in the audit log) and confirm. Press it again to undo. Bookings already made keep their split.
3. A first and last month or a tracker install invoice is refused for such a car, from any screen.

## Cancellation refunds

**Settings** > **Program**: the refund for each cancellation tier.

| When the renter cancels | Refund (default) |
| --- | --- |
| Within 24 hours of booking, 48 hours or more before the start | 95% |
| 48 hours or more before the start | 75% |
| 24 to 48 hours before the start | 50% |
| Under 24 hours, or after the start | 0% |

## An owner''s page

Open an owner from Owners. Three tabs: Overview, Terms and Invoices. **Add another car** and **New invoice** sit under the name.

1. Cars and terms, at the top: each car''s Insurance Fee, Tracker Fee, management fee (Revenue Share), Install Fee and mode, with **Edit** and History (see An owner''s terms, car by car).
2. Upfront invoices: issue the first and last month amount agreed on each car''s terms, for each car whose terms are set.
3. Owner: address, sign-in, agreements, and what is still missing for the registry forms.
4. Statements and payouts for this owner.
5. Forms C and D, with a link to the review queue.
6. Further down: **View as (owner portal)**, **Send password link** and **Send a sign-in link to the owner portal**.

## An owner''s terms, car by car

The table Cars and terms, at the top of an owner''s page and its Terms tab: each car''s Insurance Fee and Tracker Fee a month, management fee (Revenue Share), Install Fee and Management Mode, and since when they apply.

1. Press **Edit** on a car''s row. The row becomes fields: type the exact amounts (to the cent; the management fee in %). Before the Vehicle Schedule is signed you can also change the Install Fee, the Management Mode and the Onboarding Method.
2. Press **Review**. It lists each value before and after, and what happens to each one. Nothing is saved yet.
3. Not signed yet (or not approved yet): **Save** applies the numbers at once. An unsigned Vehicle Schedule is made again with them, so the owner signs these numbers; a car not approved yet keeps them for the Approve step.
4. Signed: a lower amount is in force from today, or the date you choose under Lower amounts from. No notice period is needed because it only lowers what the owner pays. A lower management fee does this while Settings > Program, Lower management % without owner signature, is on (the default); off, the owner signs an updated Vehicle Schedule first.
5. Signed: a higher Insurance Fee or Tracker Fee needs 30 days'' written notice (Enrollment Agreement 4.8). Choose the date under Higher amounts from (30 days ahead at the earliest) and write the Reason: the owner reads it.
6. Signed: a higher management fee (Revenue Share) needs the same notice and the owner''s signature. The owner is emailed the notice and an updated Vehicle Schedule to sign; it applies from the date once signed, or from the day they sign if that is later. Higher fees in the same change apply from the date by the notice either way.
7. Press **Confirm**. The owner is emailed the written notice, which is also a PDF in their portal and in the car''s History.

History, under each car, lists every period of terms (from, to, the amounts, and why: the Vehicle Schedule, a written notice, lowered) and every change with its notice. A change that has not started yet has Cancel (give the reason): the terms before it run on. An updated schedule waiting for the owner has Record signed on paper (with the date) and Withdraw it. One change at a time: cancel or finish the one waiting before making the next.

The same editor is on the car''s page (Records tab, Owner terms). The owner''s default terms (for cars whose terms are set later) and the first and last month invoice stay on the Terms tab.

> Good to know: Invoices follow the dates: a month whose Insurance Fee or Tracker Fee changes part way is billed per day at each rate. The Revenue Share of a rental is the one in force on the day it is booked.

## Change a signed car''s Management Mode

Managed, Self-Managed or Turo-Only, from a date, for a car whose Vehicle Schedule is signed. An Admin only.

1. Open the owner''s Cars and terms table (or the car''s page) and press **Change mode** on the car''s row.
2. Choose the **New Management Mode** and its Onboarding Method (the options that fit how the car is held), the date under **From**, and write the Reason: the owner reads it. Tick **The owner asked for this** only when it is their own request.
3. Press **Review**: it lists each value before and after (a Self-Managed car has no management fee; a Turo-Only car has no Fees and leaves the fleet insurance policy) and says whether the owner has to sign. Nothing is saved yet.
4. The owner asked and no amount goes up: no signature and no notice period. From today (or the date you chose) the car has the new mode, an updated Vehicle Schedule is issued with CarmaCars'' signature and the owner is emailed the notice.
5. Anything else (CarmaCars'' own decision, or a higher fee): the owner is emailed the notice and an updated Vehicle Schedule to sign, the date is at least 30 days away and the car stays as it is until it is signed. In History, **Record signed on paper** or **Withdraw it**.
6. A change dated ahead applies by itself on its date: the schedule is issued and the car moves. **Cancel** in History (give the reason) stops it and emails the owner that their terms stay as they are. The same email goes when a notice of a higher fee is cancelled.

> Good to know: A shareholder-owned car has fixed terms. A car whose schedule is not signed yet changes its mode in the terms editor, where it applies at once.

## Paid and signed

**People** > **Paid and signed**. What each owner still has to pay or sign, and how each item was done.

1. Each owner shows how many items are open and how many are done. Owners with nothing left are hidden; press Show every owner to see them.
2. Open **Checklist and quick actions**. Each line says Signed in the portal, Signed on paper, Paid by e-Transfer, Not signed, and so on.
3. Paid by e-Transfer, cheque, cash or bank transfer? Press **Record payment**. Choose Paid by, the Date received and the Reference (the cheque number for a cheque). Leave Amount empty for the full balance, or type less for a partial payment. Add a photo of the cheque or a screenshot if you have one.
4. Signed on paper? Press **Record paper signature**. Choose the Document, check Signed by and Date signed, add the witnesses where the form needs them, and upload the scan of every signed page.
5. The same checklist sits at the top of each owner''s page.
6. You rarely need to come here: an upfront or overdue owner invoice is a line on To do with **Record payment**, and an owner whose documents were sent two days ago or more and are not signed is a line with **Record paper signature**. Both pop-ups are the same forms, filled in.

A recorded payment marks the invoice paid (or partly paid), stops the automatic debit for that amount, sends the owner a receipt, and shows "Paid by e-Transfer on " in their portal. A paper signature counts as signed everywhere: the checklist, onboarding and the owner portal. The scan is kept privately with the owner''s documents.

> Watch out: Recorded the wrong thing, or a cheque bounced? Press **Void** beside it and give the reason. The invoice owes that amount again and the owner is told; a voided signature makes the item open again. Only an Admin can void.

## Forms C and D

**People** > **Owner forms**. Form C is signed on screen in the owner portal, with the witness on the same screen. Form D (and Form C on paper, if the owner prefers) is printed, signed in front of witnesses, and sent as a photo of each page.

1. Each row shows the owner, the form, the witnesses and when it was uploaded.
2. Press Open to read the photo or scan. Check each marked spot is signed or initialled.
3. Press **Approve**, or **Send back** with What to fix (the owner reads this).

![](/guides/img/admin-22-owner-forms-desktop-c20ad300.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 470; address: carmacars.ca/admin/owner-forms; pins: 1 29.2 52.3, 2 57.6 52.3, 3 76.7 52.3")

## Applications

**People** > **Applications**. Every owner application, newest first.

1. The chips filter by status: New, Waiting on owner, Approved, Declined, or All. New applications also show on To do.
2. Each row shows the application number, the owner, the car, how many of the four checks are done, and when they applied.
3. Open an application to decide.

## Decide on an application

One page holds everything: the owner, the car, the uploads, the four checks and the notes.

1. Check the driver''s licence, the ownership, the insurance and the lender or lessor. Mark each one Checked, fine, Problem or Not needed.
2. Press **Approve**. The step "Terms and first invoice" opens for each car, filled in with the owner''s negotiated terms (or the standard grid): Insurance Fee, Tracker Fee, management fee (Revenue Share), Install Fee and the first and last month amount (2 x the Insurance Fee unless you type an exact amount). Change any of them to the cent; with several cars, **Use these terms for every car** copies the first car''s numbers to the others.
3. Choose the invoices: First and last month, Registration fee (any exact amount), Tracker install (only once trackers are available) and Another invoice. For each one choose Send now, Save as draft or Already paid. Already paid asks how (e-Transfer, cash, cheque, bank transfer or other), the date and the reference: it is recorded like Record payment and the owner gets the receipt, not an invoice.
4. Press **Approve** at the bottom of the step. Nothing is set or sent before that. The owner becomes active, the documents open for one signature in their portal, only the invoices you chose are made, and the owner gets one email.
5. Missing something? Press **Ask for something**, tick what you need (for example the ownership permit or the insurance slip), add a message if you like, and press **Send to the owner**. The owner gets an email and a task in their portal; the application shows Waiting on owner until they answer.
6. Not a fit? Press **Decline**, write the Reason the owner reads, and press **Decline the application**. The owner is emailed for each car.

The application has an Invoices tab: every invoice of its cars, drafts and voids included. An application staff entered for the owner says "Entered by staff" and who; approving it sends the owner the set-up email (review the details and sign) instead of the approval email.

> Tip: Notes on the page are for staff only: **Add note** keeps a line on the record. When the owner answers a request, their answer is in the notes and the application is New again.

## Add a car for an owner

**People** > **Add a car for an owner**, or **Add another car** on an owner''s page. The owner never has to fill in the application.

1. The owner: find them by name, email or phone, or choose New owner and enter the name, email, phone and address.
2. The car: type the VIN. The car is looked up at once and shown in one line (Edit if something is wrong); no VIN at hand, add it by its plate with the year, make and model from the lists. Tap the colour, check the class, then the odometer, insurer and whether it is owned, financed or leased. Photos are optional: the listing shows sample photos until real ones are added. Upload the ownership permit, the insurance slip and the lender''s information if you have them.
3. Terms and first invoice: the same fields as Approve. For another car of the same owner they start from that owner''s terms, or their other car''s; change them for this car.
4. Who sourced the owner: Entered for CarmaCars, or I sourced this owner (only then are you recorded as the one who brought the owner). How the owner signs: by email, or on paper.
5. Press **Add the car and set it up**. The owner gets one email: review the details, correct anything, and sign. An owner with no sign-in gets the link to choose a password in that same email.

Customer service and fleet assistants add cars the same way from their portal; theirs wait in Applications for you, with the terms and invoices they proposed already filled in. On an approved application staff entered, **Send the set-up email again** sends the owner the email with a fresh link.

## Owners

**People** > **Owners**. Every owner, with their cars and where onboarding stands.

1. Each owner shows their application, how many cars, and where onboarding stands.
2. **View as (owner portal)** shows their portal. **Send password link** helps them sign in.
3. Invite an owner on file: fill in Name and Email under Invite an owner, then press **Send invitation**.

![](/guides/img/admin-12-owners-desktop-3a54d505.jpg "desktop; size: 1440 560; address: carmacars.ca/admin/owners; pins: 1 41.0 42.9, 2 37.4 49.3, 3 77.4 82.5")

The owner signs everything at once in their portal (Check and sign: the agreements, schedules and Forms A and B; the official registry forms are printed and signed in ink). The confirmations to tick, then one signature: CarmaCars countersigns at the same moment, under the signing officer''s standing authorization. A car with a second owner on the ownership waits for that owner too: they get their own link by email and sign the same documents.

## Mark a car insured (Insurer confirmed)

A program owner''s car is handed over to a renter only once the insurer confirms in writing that it is on the fleet policy. Requests, offers and payment never wait for it.

1. Each car waiting for the insurer is a line on To do: "Insurer has not confirmed : mark it insured". It says Now when a booking picks the car up soon.
2. When the insurer''s email arrives, press **Mark insured**. The date is today; change it to the date of the insurer''s email if it was earlier. Add its subject as the Reference if you like, and press **Insurer confirmed**.
3. One email for several cars? Press **Mark several insured** on the line " cars wait for the insurer". Every waiting car is ticked: untick any car the insurer did not name, check the date, and confirm them all at once.
4. The same button is on the car: Overview (**Insurer confirmed**) and the Listing tab''s checklist, item "Not on the fleet insurance policy yet".

The car is then on the fleet policy from that date: it can be handed over, its Enrollment Date is that date, its fee terms start, and the owner gets the email "Written confirmation: your car is on the fleet policy". Its paperwork (agreements, registry visit, tracker) stays on its checklist until done. A car already listed and Available stays Available.

## Owners who paid another way, and the terms you agreed

Two lines on To do keep an owner''s money right without opening their page.

1. "Record the first and last month paid by ": their first and last month invoice was voided and nothing paid is recorded. Press **Record what they paid**, type the amount for each car (tax included), or one total for several cars, how and when it was paid and the reference. A draft first and last month invoice is kept or voided, your choice. Each car''s invoice is then marked paid, the owner gets the receipt and the two prepaid months count. Never for a shareholder.
2. "Enter the terms agreed with ": their cars still use the standard grid. Press **Enter the terms**: the Management fee (Revenue Share), the Insurance Fee, the Tracker Fee, the Install Fee and the first and last month are filled in from the grid. Type what you agreed for the owner, and open a car to give it its own. A car whose schedule is signed gets an updated schedule for the owner to sign.
3. Nothing to change? Press **Not needed** or **These are correct**: the line does not come back.

## A shareholder''s own car

On the owner''s page, each car has **Shareholder’s own car**.

1. A shareholder''s own car is split 90/10 (the share in Program settings) and pays no Insurance Fee, Tracker Fee, first and last month or tracker install.
2. Press **Shareholder’s own car**, say why (it is kept in the audit log) and confirm. Press it again to undo. Bookings already made keep their split.
3. A first and last month or a tracker install invoice is refused for such a car, from any screen.

## Cancellation refunds

**Settings** > **Program**: the refund for each cancellation tier.

| When the renter cancels | Refund (default) |
| --- | --- |
| Within 24 hours of booking, 48 hours or more before the start | 95% |
| 48 hours or more before the start | 75% |
| 24 to 48 hours before the start | 50% |
| Under 24 hours, or after the start | 0% |

## An owner''s page

Open an owner from Owners. Three tabs: Overview, Terms and Invoices. **Add another car** and **New invoice** sit under the name.

1. Cars and terms, at the top: each car''s Insurance Fee, Tracker Fee, management fee (Revenue Share), Install Fee and mode, with **Edit** and History (see An owner''s terms, car by car).
2. Upfront invoices: issue the first and last month amount agreed on each car''s terms, for each car whose terms are set.
3. Owner: address, sign-in, agreements, and what is still missing for the registry forms.
4. Statements and payouts for this owner.
5. Forms C and D, with a link to the review queue.
6. Further down: **View as (owner portal)**, **Send password link** and **Send a sign-in link to the owner portal**.

![](/guides/img/admin-13-owner-desktop-819a9f8b.jpg "desktop; size: 410 1030; address: carmacars.ca/admin/owners/50a834dc-270a-4c26-b79e-6396fa7bf2e1; pins: 1 24.6 4.4, 2 16.1 32.9, 3 31.5 73.2, 4 21.2 98.1")

## An owner''s terms, car by car

The table Cars and terms, at the top of an owner''s page and its Terms tab: each car''s Insurance Fee and Tracker Fee a month, management fee (Revenue Share), Install Fee and Management Mode, and since when they apply.

1. Press **Edit** on a car''s row. The row becomes fields: type the exact amounts (to the cent; the management fee in %). Before the Vehicle Schedule is signed you can also change the Install Fee, the Management Mode and the Onboarding Method.
2. Press **Review**. It lists each value before and after, and what happens to each one. Nothing is saved yet.
3. Not signed yet (or not approved yet): **Save** applies the numbers at once. An unsigned Vehicle Schedule is made again with them, so the owner signs these numbers; a car not approved yet keeps them for the Approve step.
4. Signed: a lower amount is in force from today, or the date you choose under Lower amounts from. No notice period is needed because it only lowers what the owner pays. A lower management fee does this while Settings > Program, Lower management % without owner signature, is on (the default); off, the owner signs an updated Vehicle Schedule first.
5. Signed: a higher Insurance Fee or Tracker Fee needs 30 days'' written notice (Enrollment Agreement 4.8). Choose the date under Higher amounts from (30 days ahead at the earliest) and write the Reason: the owner reads it.
6. Signed: a higher management fee (Revenue Share) needs the same notice and the owner''s signature. The owner is emailed the notice and an updated Vehicle Schedule to sign; it applies from the date once signed, or from the day they sign if that is later. Higher fees in the same change apply from the date by the notice either way.
7. Press **Confirm**. The owner is emailed the written notice, which is also a PDF in their portal and in the car''s History.

History, under each car, lists every period of terms (from, to, the amounts, and why: the Vehicle Schedule, a written notice, lowered) and every change with its notice. A change that has not started yet has Cancel (give the reason): the terms before it run on. An updated schedule waiting for the owner has Record signed on paper (with the date) and Withdraw it. One change at a time: cancel or finish the one waiting before making the next.

The same editor is on the car''s page (Records tab, Owner terms). The owner''s default terms (for cars whose terms are set later) and the first and last month invoice stay on the Terms tab.

> Good to know: Invoices follow the dates: a month whose Insurance Fee or Tracker Fee changes part way is billed per day at each rate. The Revenue Share of a rental is the one in force on the day it is booked.

## Pay an owner a flat monthly amount

Some owners want the same amount every month for a car instead of a revenue share and fees. An Admin only, car by car.

1. Open the owner''s Cars and terms table (or the car''s page) and press **Pay** on the car''s row.
2. Choose **Flat monthly payment**, type the **Amount a month** (for example 900.00), the date under **From** and, if it ends, the **Last day**. Write the Reason (kept in the history).
3. Press **Review**: it says what happens and lists any monthly invoice already issued for those days. Then press **Confirm**.
4. From that date the owner''s statement pays the amount every month (a part month by the day), with no revenue share and no Insurance Fee or Tracker Fee. Rentals ending on those days stay with CarmaCars, in the company figures.
5. Back to revenue share: press **Pay**, choose Revenue share and the date. The flat period ends the day before; every period stays in the list.

> Good to know: A month already on an approved owner statement never changes: a new date starts after it. A monthly invoice already issued for flat days stays: void or credit it. A booking expense on a flat car is CarmaCars'' own unless you press **Charge to the owner** beside it on the booking (an Admin only): it is then an owner cost on their statement. Owner costs recorded on the owner''s account (tickets, tolls, damage of their own use) are charged as before.

## Change a signed car''s Management Mode

Managed, Self-Managed or Turo-Only, from a date, for a car whose Vehicle Schedule is signed. An Admin only.

1. Open the owner''s Cars and terms table (or the car''s page) and press **Change mode** on the car''s row.
2. Choose the **New Management Mode** and its Onboarding Method (the options that fit how the car is held), the date under **From**, and write the Reason: the owner reads it. Tick **The owner asked for this** only when it is their own request.
3. Press **Review**: it lists each value before and after (a Self-Managed car has no management fee; a Turo-Only car has no Fees and leaves the fleet insurance policy) and says whether the owner has to sign. Nothing is saved yet.
4. The owner asked and no amount goes up: no signature and no notice period. From today (or the date you chose) the car has the new mode, an updated Vehicle Schedule is issued with CarmaCars'' signature and the owner is emailed the notice.
5. Anything else (CarmaCars'' own decision, or a higher fee): the owner is emailed the notice and an updated Vehicle Schedule to sign, the date is at least 30 days away and the car stays as it is until it is signed. In History, **Record signed on paper** or **Withdraw it**.
6. A change dated ahead applies by itself on its date: the schedule is issued and the car moves. **Cancel** in History (give the reason) stops it and emails the owner that their terms stay as they are. The same email goes when a notice of a higher fee is cancelled.

> Good to know: A shareholder-owned car has fixed terms. A car whose schedule is not signed yet changes its mode in the terms editor, where it applies at once.

## Paid and signed

**People** > **Paid and signed**. What each owner still has to pay or sign, and how each item was done.

1. Each owner shows how many items are open and how many are done. Owners with nothing left are hidden; press Show every owner to see them.
2. Open **Checklist and quick actions**. Each line says Signed in the portal, Signed on paper, Paid by e-Transfer, Not signed, and so on.
3. Paid by e-Transfer, cheque, cash or bank transfer? Press **Record payment**. Choose Paid by, the Date received and the Reference (the cheque number for a cheque). Leave Amount empty for the full balance, or type less for a partial payment. Add a photo of the cheque or a screenshot if you have one.
4. Signed on paper? Press **Record paper signature**. Choose the Document, check Signed by and Date signed, add the witnesses where the form needs them, and upload the scan of every signed page.
5. The same checklist sits at the top of each owner''s page.
6. You rarely need to come here: an upfront or overdue owner invoice is a line on To do with **Record payment**, and an owner whose documents were sent two days ago or more and are not signed is a line with **Record paper signature**. Both pop-ups are the same forms, filled in.

A recorded payment marks the invoice paid (or partly paid), stops the automatic debit for that amount, sends the owner a receipt, and shows "Paid by e-Transfer on " in their portal. A paper signature counts as signed everywhere: the checklist, onboarding and the owner portal. The scan is kept privately with the owner''s documents.

> Watch out: Recorded the wrong thing, or a cheque bounced? Press **Void** beside it and give the reason. The invoice owes that amount again and the owner is told; a voided signature makes the item open again. Only an Admin can void.

## Forms C and D

**People** > **Owner forms**. Form C is signed on screen in the owner portal, with the witness on the same screen. Form D (and Form C on paper, if the owner prefers) is printed, signed in front of witnesses, and sent as a photo of each page.

1. Each row shows the owner, the form, the witnesses and when it was uploaded.
2. Press Open to read the photo or scan. Check each marked spot is signed or initialled.
3. Press **Approve**, or **Send back** with What to fix (the owner reads this).

1. Open **Requests**. Filter by New, Waiting on the renter, Pushed back, Offer out or Offer expired.
2. Waiting shows how long the renter has waited. Open the booking number.

3. On the Review tab, check the request: the car is free, the renter, the places.
4. Press **Adjust the booking** to change the car, dates, places, price or extras, then **Save changes**.
5. Add a message and press **Send the offer**. Within your limit you can also use **Approve (within my limit)** or **Approve and send the pay link**.
6. Can''t do it? **Decline** with Reason and any alternative. Need to know more? **Ask the renter**.

> Tip: Reply within 5 minutes: send the offer, or ask the renter what you need. That is the "First reply in opening hours" measure on your scorecard. Requests waiting longer show in red.

Opening a request takes it for you: the others see "Being answered by" your name and cannot answer it until you send, decline or leave (20 minutes, renewed while you work). One someone else holds shows who, with the buttons off; it opens to you when their claim runs out, or ask an Admin to take it over. Sales: a request from the website shows "Opens to you at" a time for its first 15 minutes, and a To do task says when it opens; after that whoever opens it first answers it, customer service included.

## An enquiry on an example car

Some cars on the site are marked "Example car": samples that show the kind of cars we rent. A request on one is an enquiry, never a booking.

1. The task Suggest a similar real car comes to To do with the enquiry number (EQ-1001 and up), the car asked for, the dates and the contact. When a real car was free for those dates, the task names it after **Free:** (the same make and model first, else the same class and body at a similar price), and the person was told we have a similar car and will confirm it within 2 hours.
2. Check the named car is still right for them (or find a real car of the same kind and price that is free for those dates), and make a **New quote** for it.
3. Call or email the person with the car and the price, then mark the task done.

> Tip: Reply within the first reply target, as for any request. Never offer the example car itself: it does not exist.

## A request from a vehicle page

Every make, model, year and trim page (carmacars.ca/cars/toyota/rav4/2023/xle, for example) has Request it, for the exact car the person wants.

1. The request arrives as an enquiry with the car named in the message ("About the car: 2023 Toyota RAV4 XLE") and an Enquiry task in To do.
2. If we have that car, or one close to it, free for their dates, make a **New quote** for it. If not, suggest the nearest car of the same kind and price.
3. Reply by email or phone, then mark the task done.

> Tip: The pages say only what the data says: EPA fuel use, the Canadian trims and our own cars. Never promise equipment the page does not list.

## A buyer lead from a /buy page

Every vehicle page has a for-sale twin (carmacars.ca/buy/toyota/rav4/2023/xle) with "Find me this car", and twins for financing, detailing and body shop work with their own request: a name, an email or phone, and when.

1. The lead is in **Owner leads** (customer service: **Owners and enquiries**), Buyer leads (kind buyer, finance, detailing or body shop), with the car and what they asked, and a To do line for Sales: A buyer asked us to find a car, Someone asked about financing or leasing a car, A detailing request, or A body shop request.
2. If one of our cars of that kind is for sale (an Admin flags it with its price), offer it. If not, offer to rent them the car for a week first, and say what we can find. We do not lend or lease: on a financing question, say so and offer the rental. For detailing or body shop work, give a time and a price, and always offer a rental while their car is in (an insurance replacement rental when it is a claim). For mechanical work (a "Mechanical work to arrange" task: an oil change, brakes, tires, a tow and the like), CarmaCars does not do the work: book it with a trusted shop or recommend one, never promise the shop''s price or time, and offer a rental while their car is in.
3. Press **Take it**, then **Update** as you go: contacted, qualified, converted or closed with the reason.

> Tip: We mostly rent cars. Never say a car is for sale unless an Admin flagged it; the page shows it with its price when one is.

## The booking''s rental agreements

The Rental agreements card keeps both agreements in step with the booking.

1. Any change after signing makes a new version by itself. A change to the dates, the price, the car, the drivers or the coverage waits for the renter''s signature: they get the link by email and text, and the card says "Agreement v3 waiting for signature".

3. One is wrong? Open **Reject this one** under it, type the reason the renter reads and press **Reject**.
4. Then press **Approve all**: everything still waiting is approved at once (the Protection Plan too). A document the system refuses is named with the reason; the rest are approved.

> Tip: Each opening is logged. An Admin can do the same from Admin > To do. Field staff review the licence images (not the coverage) of bookings on their own jobs in the next 7 days from their My jobs: the booking history says the role, field.

## Which credit cards include rental car coverage?

Renters ask this often. **Renters** > **Card coverage** (every function has it under Rentals or Bookings) is your quick reference: what to say, what to check, and the list.

1. Send the renter `carmacars.ca/credit-card-rental-coverage`: each card''s car value limit (MSRP), longest rental, key exclusions, its official guide and the day we last checked it.
2. Ask which car they want. Most Canadian cards stop at a car priced $65,000 or $85,000, and many luxury models are priced higher. Give them the car''s model year and trim so they can check.
3. Never tell a renter they are covered. Their card''s issuer decides that: ask them to call the number on the back of their card about this car and these dates. CarmaCars does not decide claims.
4. Over the limit, an excluded make, a debit card or a longer rental than the card allows: offer OPCF 27 on their own auto policy or the CarmaCars Protection Plan.

> Tip: A card marked Unverified came from a published summary, not the issuer''s guide. Something wrong or out of date in the list? Tell an Admin: they correct it in Settings > Card coverage.

## Review requests

Renters are asked for a review by email and text after each trip. **Renters** > **Review requests** shows the ones on hold and the Google reviews to match.

1. On hold: the booking has a charge that is not settled or waived yet (late return, kilometres, fuel, cleaning, smoking, damage, tolls) or an open incident. It leaves the list by itself once the charges are settled or waived.
2. The renter should be asked now anyway? Press **Send anyway**. Should never be asked? Press **Do not ask**.
3. Google reviews: a possible match to a renter shows "possible match". Press **Confirm** if it is them, **Not this renter** if not, or **Match to a booking** with the booking number.
4. On a booking, the card Review requests has **Ask for a review** (for example after a call that went well) and **Mark reviewed** when the renter says they already left one.

> Tip: Never offer anything for a review and never ask only happy renters: everyone gets the same message and the same Google link.

## A change to a confirmed booking

On a booking''s Changes tab you can propose new dates, times or another car, as an Admin does: set the change, write the reason, press **Preview the price**, then **Send to the renter**. The renter has 48 hours to accept and sign the amendment. You also send a new signing link to an additional driver from the booking screen.

A booking past its return time shows the late return panel. Work it in order:

| Button | When |

> Tip: Reply within 5 minutes: send the offer, or ask the renter what you need. That is the "First reply in opening hours" measure on your scorecard. Requests waiting longer show in red.

Opening a request takes it for you: the others see "Being answered by" your name and cannot answer it until you send, decline or leave (20 minutes, renewed while you work). One someone else holds shows who, with the buttons off; it opens to you when their claim runs out, or ask an Admin to take it over. Sales: a request from the website shows "Opens to you at" a time for its first 15 minutes, and a To do task says when it opens; after that whoever opens it first answers it, customer service included.

Your menu: To do, Today, My scorecard and My sales, then Requests and offers, Send an offer, Add a rental, New quote, Calendar and Owner leads.

## Requests, offers and new quotes

1. **Requests and offers**: the same queue customer service works. Answer requests and follow offers out.
2. **Send an offer**: one screen for a caller, sent at once, as in chapter 2. **New quote** still makes a request to offer later.
3. An offer that is out: **Edit the offer**, then **Save and send the update**.

![](/guides/img/va-sales-02-requests-desktop-2ab1d17d.jpg "desktop; size: 1230 580; address: carmacars.ca/va/requests; pins: 1 39.8 59.5")

> Tip: Your first reply target is 5 minutes, the "Quote sent" measure on your scorecard. Follow every offer out before it expires.

## Check the renter''s licence

Sales approve the renter''s licence like customer service: the licence front, the licence back and the selfie. The proof of coverage and the Protection Plan stay with customer service and Admins.

1. On **My work** > **To do**, **Licences to check** lists each booking with an image waiting, the longest wait first. Press **Review the licence**.
2. On a booking, the card **Renter licence** has the same: press **Review the licence**.
3. Look at each image: the name and date of birth match the booking, class G2 or G, valid past the return, no alteration, the selfie matches the licence photo.
4. One is wrong? Open **Reject this one** under it, type the reason the renter reads and press **Reject**. The renter is told and asked for a new image.
5. Then press **Approve all**: every image still waiting is approved at once. An image the system refuses is named with the reason.

> Tip: The booking history says who decided and the role, sales. Each opening of the images is logged and the links last one minute.

## In person or remote

Every Sales person works in one of two modes, on the same Sales screens. An Admin sets yours; it shows at the top of To do and on My sales.

|  | In person (Toronto) | Remote (anywhere) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commission | Under 50 rental days in the month 10%, from 50 days 15%, from 100 days 20% | Under 50 rental days 5%, from 50 days 10%, from 100 days 15% |
| Credit | Walk-ins, handovers you close, partner visits and the rentals you source | Only the rentals you source. A website request you answer with the first offer during one of your blocks counts as yours. Walk-ins and partner deals earn nothing |
| Hours | You choose | At least 20 hours a week of Thursday to Sunday afternoons (noon to 6 pm, Toronto time), replying within 15 minutes to the chats, texts and calls assigned to you |
| Every day | Nothing set | Marketplace and classified reposts, social media DM replies, three follow-ups on every quote, long-term and business outreach |
| Every month | Nothing set | 400 touches. Under 400 when the month ends, the month''s rate is one tier lower: 15% becomes 10%, 10% becomes 5%, 5% becomes 2.5% |

## Remote: your duties

On **My work** > **To do**, **Remote duties** shows this month''s touches against 400, today''s checklist, the peak hours you scheduled this week and your reply time.

1. Most touches count by themselves: an offer you send, a message or text you send from the portal, a live chat you answer (once a day for each chat), a call or text from the phone line, an ad you post, a call or message to a car owner.
2. For anything else press **Log a touch**: choose the type and add the link of the post, profile or listing if there is one.
3. The checklist ticks itself as the day''s touches come in. Three follow-ups on every quote stays open while a deal of yours has fewer than three.
4. Under My availability choose this week or next, press **Add a block** for each time you will be on, then **Save the week**. Days already past stay as they were.
5. A website request you answer with the first offer during a block is credited to you as sourced, even if you chose Entered for CarmaCars. Off your blocks it stays a claim for an Admin.

> Tip: An Admin can void a touch logged by mistake. Once an Admin approves a month, its mode, its rates and its touches no longer change; a refund can still lower the tier, as for everyone.

## My sales

Open **My work** > **My sales**. It shows your own sales and commissions only.

1. Commissions comes first. Your rate depends on your mode and the rental days of the month: in person 10%, 15% from 50 days, 20% from 100; remote 5%, 10% and 15%. The bar shows your days against the target of 100, and says when your rate rises. By month gives each month in one line: the mode, the days, the rate and, for remote, the touches and any drop.
2. The tiles show this week: quotes created, offers sent, rentals added, bookings confirmed, conversion, booked revenue and follow-ups due. Press **By month** for months, **By week** for weeks.
3. By week (or By month) lists each period with the same figures, newest first.
4. Follow-ups due lists your open deals with what to do next: send the offer, follow up before the offer expires, or follow up while the renter signs and pays. Red means it is past due.
5. Deals lists every booking you created, added or sent an offer on in the last 180 days, with its status and what it counts. Open a request, an offer or a rental you added from its number.

| Figure | How it is counted |
| --- | --- |
| Credited to you | A quote you created, a rental you added, or a website request whose first offer you sent. An Admin can give a deal to someone else. |
| Quotes created, offers sent, rentals added | Counted on the day they happened. |
| Bookings confirmed, booked revenue | Counted on the day the booking was confirmed. |
| Conversion | Of the deals credited to you in the period, the share confirmed so far. |
| Booked revenue | The rental charge before tax, after discounts. A cancelled booking counts only what was kept; refunds come off. |
| Rental days (Sales) | The days of the completed, paid rentals you sourced that end in the month. The month''s tier applies to all of that month''s rentals. |

> Tip: Sales commissions are approved after the month ends, when the month''s tier is known. A refund that drops the month under a tier lowers every commission of that month; anything already paid comes off your next payment.

## Owner leads

1. Owner leads: each enquiry with the name, contact, car and status.
2. Press **Take it** to make it yours, then call the owner.
3. Press **Update** to set the status. When you close a lead, say why.
4. Owner applications, last 90 days, shows who applied and how far onboarding has come.
